1,820070,Cube Universe,Beosar UG (haftungsbeschränkt),Indie/RPG/Early Access,"Apr 24, 2018","Explore a nearly infinite universe, filled with planets of all kinds! Every world in this game is procedurally generated, including quests that you can do to advance your character up to level 50. Venture into deep caves to find precious materials to craft armor and weapons. Or simply spend your time exploring the epic landscapes with mountains that are as high as actual mountains, find a place where you want to stay and build your house or whatever you can imagine, with a building height of up to 2048 meters!This game is currently in Early Access and we are working hard to add new content and features as fast as we can. But first, let's see what you can already see and do in the game:PlanetsTerraEarth-like planet with oceans, forests, plains, deserts, jungles, tundras, taigas, etc.LunarMoon-like planet with some rare materials that cannot be found on other planets, e.g. lunar essence from lunar elementals and Mithril ore.QuestsProcedurally generated quests that are based on the local area, e.g. you have to kill raptors in the jungle to restore nature's balance or get some furs to keep someone warm in colder regions.Combat systemChoose a weapon instead of a class - your character can use any weapon, but you shouldn't change it too often since you will get out of practice. Currently, only fire staffs are supported.CraftingCraft a variety of things, like armor, food, building materials, etc. There are a lot of professions and you can craft the basic stuff from all of them, but can master only a few to craft advanced items like modules for your matter manipulator.BuildingBuild with smaller blocks than in other voxel games, giving your creativity more freedom. Blocks are only 0.5 meters big and you can build up to 2048 meters high, which is much higher than in most other similar games.Coming soon...Now, let's talk about all the planned features that will be added as development continues. The following list is ordered by the date we plan to add the mentioned features. Additionally, we will add more content for existing features, e.g. more quests and planet types.Dungeons and raidsMMO-like dungeons and raids that are procedurally generated. Imagine a pyramid with labyrinthine corridors that ultimately lead to bosses that will hopefully drop your desired item.Mods and user-generated contentSupport for easy modding, including a terrain editor for custom terrains with custom quests. Most of the content is already defined in XML files, so we will only have to add some logic that loads user-generated XML files and some code for interaction between different mods. Additionally, a Lua API will be added to support more advanced mods.Mods will not only be easy to create, but also easy to install - if you connect to a modded server, you will not even have to manually install mods since this will be done automatically.Space stationsFeeling lonely in space? No one can hear you scream? Well, then visit one of the space stations and meet with other folks! Trade your goods on the intergalactic market, buy upgrades for your spaceship and much more!Battles in spaceFight other players and NPCs in epic battles in space. Upgrade your spaceship or buy a better one to stand a chance against those filthy space pirates - or to be fast enough to outrun them.PvPFight other players on battlegrounds.Asteroid fieldsLooking for rare materials?

5,743230,Baseball Mogul 2018,"Sports Mogul, Inc.",Casual/Simulation/Sports/Strategy,"Apr 24, 2018","What is Baseball Mogul?Baseball Mogul® begins in any year you choose, from 1900 to present day with the full roster of your favorite team -- or an entirely fictional team of your own creation. As General Manager (GM), your job is to build the best lineup of players to take your team to the World Series. You can make complex player trades and sign players to multi-year contracts as you build your team, but you'll have to compete with the other General Managers, and negotiate with the player's agents. As GM you also have to manage all the finances for your ball club, making sure that the team doesn't go bankrupt. Raise revenue for your team by setting the price of tickets and concessions, and selling the TV broadcast rights, while you manage your team's expenses by setting the budget for your farm system, player scouts, medical staff, and player payroll. But be careful, because fans can be fickle if your team doesn't win or if your tickets become too expensive! If you don’t succeed in your first year, you get a new chance with Baseball Mogul’s in-depth amateur draft. You pick and choose from the best high school and college talent around the world. If your new players are good enough, have them join your team right away, otherwise send them to your minor league franchise for training and improvement. Your involvement as GM does not stop in the team's front office. Baseball Mogul gives you complete control over your team on the field. You start by setting the starting defense, batting order and pitching rotation for your team. On game day, you choose your level of involvement. You can retire to the luxury box and make calls to the dugout as needed. Or you can take control of each player, choosing what pitches to throw and when to bunt or go for an extra base. A powerful game engine simulates each pitch of the game based on customized player ratings and over 100 years of historical data, assuring you the maximum realism possible! Baseball Mogul is designed to help you manage your team over many simulated years. Manage your team one day at a time, or let the computer simulate weeks or months at a stretch so you can play for virtual years or decades. As your players age, their abilities mature and decline realistically. Don't forget to build your team for the long term, rather than spending all your money on free agents this season. Watch your team rise and fall in the standings, watch your bank statement, and read the news stories to stay on top of what's happening with all the ball clubs in both leagues. If you pick the right players, manage your finances well, and stick to a winning strategy, your team may win the Championship, and you too may become a Baseball Mogul!Backwards CompatibilityBaseball Mogul 2018 automatically loads databases from previous versions of Baseball Mogul",Minimum:OS: Windows VistaMemory: 512 MB RAMStorage: 1 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Not a demanding game on GPU or CPU.

Fruitbat Factory is bringing Chuusotsu! to fans all over the world in dual language (English and Japanese text, characters fully voiced in Japanese).StoryUnder the P3 law enacted under the Global People's Federation, citizens are ranked according to the Authorization Seals issued by the world government. As spring arrives, the manga lover Marisugawa Arue, set back by a long-lasting illness, finds herself having to live her life as a ""chuusotsu"" - a person with no education beyond middle school. The chuusotsu are not in possession of any Seals, and are considered to be failures at life. As such, their Authorized Power level is only 5 - young Arue's future is already looking mighty bleak. ""How will I be able to accomplish my goals now...""In order to break free of her grim situation, and reach her true goal in life, Arue applies for a government relief program where she will... Share a room with other chuusotsu!? Her two roommates are overwhelmingly unique: a taciturn girl in a souvenir jacket and a crazy chuuni girl. And then the three girls are given group challenges to clear. What makes a wonderful life? Synchronize your minds and philosophize on this proposition. ""There's no way incompetents like us can do philosophy...""Their time is limited, and failure means that they will immediately get kicked out of the apartment! Will Arue manage to successfully complete the philosophical challenges and achieve a happy, steady-going life...!? This is a philosophical story of how the three girls considered lame ducks by the society spend their unusual youth in a world where Authorization Seals decide the lives of all people.CharactersMarisugawa Arue (Voice: Takeda Eruru)The protagonist. A manga lover with delicate health.Arue’s mental fortitude is also on the weak side, and because of those issues, her academic performance was so poor that she has ended up a chuusotsu (a person with no education beyond middle school). However, although she was a shy, fragile girl back in middle school, Arue has now leveled up into a blunt riposte machine.She has signed up for the room sharing program with extraordinary enthusiasm for the sake of getting the strongest job of 'Government Employee.' That's why she gets super passionate toward, and aggressively tackles the challenges she faces, whose failure would get her kicked out of the apartment.Arue’s really crazy about manga. She cannot and will not stop reading it.Favorite Drawing Pens: Cobac, Multi-Line""You have got to be more serious! Don't you understand that if we get kicked out of here we're going to be just ordinary unemployed 15-year-old girls!?""Hachisuka Koiro (Voice: Inukai Ao)One of Arue's roomates, who made her first contact with her in a love hotel street. Wearing a rabbit-printed jacket as her trademark, she was well known as ""Beachside White Rabbit"" back in her hometown. Having left home and quitting her role as the strongest gang leader, she has become just another chuusotsu.Although her being taciturn and great at fighting scares people off, on the inside she is actually a good girl who is pure and airheaded. Koiro is an ally of justice, and takes a firm stance against all sorts of immorality. She is starving practically all the time. You can't fight on an empty stomach.Favorite Food: Rice (any brand)""...Salted rice tastes good, you know?""Fujisaki Arara (Voice: Ohyama Chiroru)A crazy little girl who is embarrassing to be around.Ever since her childhood, all Arara has been doing is yelling out that she will defeat what she calls ""The Ruler of the World,"" which steadily led her up the stairs to becoming a chuusotsu.She is the kind of girl who talks to a stuffed animal tied up to her arm. Arara only learns the things that interest her, and often does not know about commonplace things. She's also a picky eater and hence, as you can see, is flat as a board.Favorite Celebrity: J.

38,783250,CONTAINMENT,Planet X Game Studios,Casual/Indie,"Apr 24, 2018","SUMMARY<br />
A fun, uniquely challenging and brutal arcade game with beautiful 3D visuals inspired by the Breakout games, with 80 levels over 4 phases, with different brick shape themes. The game forces you to split your focus 4 ways, as you must try to control FOUR different paddles at the same time on each edge of the screen, while trying to maintain control over the ball in more and more chaotic situations! The aim of the game is to “contain” and destroy the bricks, before they drift out of the screen or touch your paddles! The bricks have physics based collisions and are fully destructible! The mouse controls all 4 paddles at once, so easy to learn but difficult to master! Your reflexes will be put to the test!<br />
<br />
SPECIAL 3 STAR TYPES, STAR RATINGS AND CROWNS GAME PLAY SYSTEM<br />
<br />
Star Types <br />
There are 3 Types of stars needed to finish a level <br />
– The Time Left Star, <br />
- The Lives Lost Star, and <br />
- The Bricks Lost Star. <br />
<br />
Star ratings<br />
Each of these stars have Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum difficulty levels. Similarly, there are also 4 types of Crowns, the Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum crowns.<br />
<br />
Crowns<br />
The Crown achieved for each level is decided based on the overall minimum star rating achieved. For example, if you have obtained a minimum of a bronze star for each Star Type, then you have achieved the Bronze Crown. If you have bronze stars for two Star Types, and a Platinum star for the third Star Type, then you will still only have achieved the Bronze Crown. Similarly, if you have a minimum of 3 silver stars, you will have achieved the Silver Crown. If you have a minimum of 3 gold stars, you will have achieved the Gold Crown. If you have a minimum of 3 platinum stars, you will have achieved the Platinum Crown. <br />
<br />
<br />
POWER-UPS<br />
There are twenty different types of power-ups, some of which can be combined for powerful combos!<br />
<br />
CONTROLS<br />
The controls are very straight forward to grasp, but surprisingly difficult to master. There are 4 paddles, one at each edge of the platform. The left and right paddles move up and down the screen on one axis only, by only following the upward and downward movement of the mouse. Similarly, the top and bottom paddles move left and right on one axis only, by only following the right and left movement of the mouse. <br />
<br />
HELPER BLOCKS<br />
In order to ease the player into the game, initial levels provide “helper blocks” that block random sides of a level and allow the player to focus on the other edges, while getting used to the concept of using 4 different paddles moving on different axes. But only the initial levels! Once past them, you’re on your own!<br />
<br />
LEVELS<br />
The game currently has 80 levels, and more levels and themes may be added as updates to the game in the future depending on the success and popularity of the game. The 80 levels are divided into 4 different phases. <br />
o The first phase introduces Rectangular and Square faced 3d bricks. <br />
o	The second set introduces Pentagonal 3d bricks. <br />
o	The third set introduces Hexagonal 3d bricks.<br />
o	The fourth set introduces Spherical and Ovoid shaped 3d bricks.<br />
All these bricks are combined and mixed and matched to create more and more complex levels.<br />
<br />
PROGRESS<br />
At the start of the game, only the first level will be unlocked. You need a minimum of a Bronze Crown, in order to unlock the next level and progress. The highest achievement possible for each level is to get the Platinum Crown. But the required achievements for this are really punishing, so if you can do this for all the levels then you’ve really mastered the controls and the game!<br />
<br />
SAVE FILES<br />
There are 3 Save files available. The game will auto-save your progress between levels. During the play through of a level, the game is not saved, so game progress will be lost if you exit during a level. However, for all those stat-lovers out there, total game play time, total lives lost, total power-ups collected, etc., will still be saved to the game stats page.<br />

After much study, they came to the conclusion that the only way to eliminate 100% of bacteria would be to eliminate them individually. So they partnered with the military to develop a micro-robot that could stand in front of the bacteria, eliminate them and repair all the damage done by them. And this micro robot was christened Flurius. Given name in reference to sodium fluoride (fluorine), which is the substance used in oral hygiene products most known to people, and serve as fuel for your jetpack.Game modesNormalIn the normal way, Flurius confronts bacteria in the mouths of ordinary humans like us.

This offer lasts until May 1st.About the GameFrostpunk is a brand-new title from the creators of This War of Mine. It’s a society survival game that asks what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of extinction. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city’s ruler has to manage both the citizens and the infrastructure they live in. The leader’s tactical skills face challenges that will frequently question morality and the basic foundations of what we consider organized society. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And......who will you become in the process?THE CITY MUST SURVIVEFrostpunk is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes with a cost. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your people to survive.MAINTAIN HOPESurvival is about hope and the will to live. Your ability to spark and maintain them both in your people will be a deciding factor in your success.MAKE THE LAWSociety is a group of people who abide by the same rules and share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICESSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.GO BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN The main story campaign can go different ways depending on your playstyle, but it is still not the only challenge to tackle.

Recipes can be marketed or become tools and decorative objects of greater value or to customize your homes and warehouses.Features:● Manage your stores, from ordering objects to setting prices.● The world of MSS reacts to all your decisions, including prices, support for the crown and the church and the reputation of your stores.● Combine components and objects to create higher-value stock and exchange or sell them.● Modify and order your employees to work one way or another depending on your style of play.● Depending on the king or queen that governs, there will be laws that will suit you more or less depending on your financial strategy.● During the course of the game, new events will appear that will change the way you play. For example, a global illness or a neighboring war.● You can go from house to house fulfilling your previously accepted orders to get money or unique items.Medieval Shopkeeper Simulator is an early access title that is in the alpha stage of development.

(First quarter of 2018).Storage refactoring: The management of objects will become a totally new and improved game mechanic: players can organize their stock of objects as they wish. Do you need more space to store objects? Buy and improve an empty warehouse in the city. (First quarter of 2018).Kingdom 2.0: A new generation system by a procedure that will improve performance and allow you to explore in each game a new, different kingdom. These new realms will contain more diverse buildings, specific events, more characters and much more.

STORY<br />
<br />
A long time ago, there was a mushroom country, living in tranquility: it was Boduria. Boduria was ruled by King Bodur for 1000 years. King Bodur had an allied warlock, called Gaddar. Gaddar was also the one and only poisonous mushroom in the land. One fine day, Gaddar wanted to turn some of the mushrooms in the village into poisonous ones, just like him. Believing non-poisonous ones are weak, Gaddar's aim was to poison the the folk and become the King. King Bodur didn't let him get away with it, and exiled Gaddar. Nevertheless, Gaddar had the antidote to dispel the poison. Before it's too late, King assigned 3 of his best warriors to catch Gaddar and bring the potion back. Thus: Yuppi, Jumpi and Dombi embarked on a tough adventure.<br />

They can learn many languages at the same time that lays a good foundation for the language ability and other aspects of study in the future.<br />
We developed this game by absorbing the scientific research results of the current developmental psychology, multiple intelligence and games of early education for babies’ characteristics at this stage. The game conveys information to babies with text, images and audios, stimulating the infants’ brain synaptic connections, exercising babies’language abilities, perception, memory, creativity and imagination so that cultivate infants and young children's interest in reading, music and mathematics, etc.. Children’ brains will be more powerful and  more complete through scientific stimulation.<br />
<br />
Features of the software:<br />
1.Professional early education: It is tailored to children according to the learning characteristics of children aged 0-3 years old, which fully conforms to the scientific theoretical practice of development psychology, multiple intelligence and games of early education.<br />
2.Bilingual teaching: By using two of the world's most widely used languages--English and Chinese as instruction languages which lays a better multilingual learning basis for children and broadens children’s international vision. <br />
3.Time control: the software is set to study no more than half an hour, so that it can guarantee the baby's eyes would not be harmed.<br />
4.Radom learning content: Babies can learn different things every time so that they will not be tired of the content.<br />
5.Rich content: Looking, listening and thinking at the same time can develop children's language ability, ways of thinking, music, graphics, perception, memory and other abilities, comprehensively improve the babies’ multiple intelligence.<br />
6.Studies have confirmed that watching a lot of entertainment programs will weaken the children’s learning interest. Our game has lovely game interface, delicate graphics, beautiful sound which make children happy. It can replace entertainment programs and cultivate baby's interest in learning, it lays a good foundation of learning for babies and let children win at the starting line.<br />
<br />
In addition to this game, parents should do more contact and action games with infants and young children and give them suitable toys that match their ages and also take children out and do more outdoor and social activities.For example,when a baby can walk,water and sand are very good toys for them.They put on clothes that they are not afraid of getting dirty ,and they can be given more opportunities to play with water and sand on the premise of safety.<br />

As you collect the coin, the speed of the enemies will change.  You can't shoot them yet because you have to unlock it by upgrading the bullet damage upgrade.  So, you will have to try avoiding them until the first bullet damage upgrade is purchased.  Each coin you collect will not only reset the timer, but it will also add more to your money which you can use to buy more upgrades.  Upgrades are awesome.

Electricity became the main resource on the planet. Giant power plants had been created. Plants are using tesla coils to transfer electricity.<br />

The player can choose his own combat-vehicle class. Each class differs in its type of mounted weapon type, and maneuverability. Class playing inside each team and close cooperation is the core element of combat gameplay. Players closely interact with each other by recharging shields, feeding energy and restoring each others’ ammo capacity.<br />

If so, then this is the game for you. Hard way to heaven is an old-school platformer game, which will take you a lot of effort to complete.<br />
This is why there are only 2 difficulties in the game: hard and impossible. The only exception is the first level which became a lot easier than we anticipated.<br />
If by some miracle you finish all the solo levels, 4 extra levels will appear in the menu. They seem quite similar to the other levels, but these were the original ones which were later made easier because of their extreme difficulty. We are eager to see how many of you are able to finish even one of these original levels. ;)<br />

That’s why, when he finally managed to transfer into the renowned Rintoku Academy, he immediately fell head over heels for two Sakuras!Nanako Sakura’s classes are strict, but at home, she turns into an overbearing mother.Sakura Kirishima may seem cold and unfriendly, but she is always ready to lend a helping hand as the class representative.These two girls are outwardly indifferent to Tohru, but put the three of them together and sparks begin to fly.In the sakura-colored season of spring, two fussy Sakuras have been caught in a light-hearted love triangle.The Internet Friend vs. The Childhood Friend""You know how romance games always give the main character that best friend who tells him about the girls? I want to be that guy.""Naoki Fuse, the self-proclaimed best friend, is always ready to tease Tohru about his situation with the two Sakuras.But, unbeknownst to him, he is one side of yet another light-hearted love triangle.Akira Nitta has been Naoki's friend since before they could read and write, and is now finally living under the same (dorm) roof as him.Kurumi Tachibana used to be Naoki's MMO raiding partner, but they were separated before she ever got a chance to meet him in real life or tell him how she felt.""I understand him better than anyone else.""Akira and Kurumi have Naoki stumped for the first time in his life. And so, Tohru finally gets a chance to see things from the other side.The curtains rise on this desolate showdown for love.CharactersNanako SakuraThe kind dorm mother of the Tsukimi Athletics Dorm who wakes the students up every morning. She cheerfully makes breakfast every morning just for Tohru Inaba, but not out of special consideration for him. Rather, it’s because the other two residents, Naoki and Akira, usually skip breakfast. Coincidentally, one of her concerns is that those two have been skipping their practices as well.She acts as a parent to Tohru, supporting, encouraging, and scolding him as he works to become an official member of the Fine Arts Club. At school, Nanako transforms into a strict and imposing homeroom teacher, with a firm line drawn between the two roles.However, since witnessing Tohru being fussed over by Sakura, the vice president of the Fine Arts Club, her mood at the dorm has been noticeably worse.Nanako specializes in general housework, honed from her time living alone, and cooking simmered dishes such as nikujaga, curry, and hot pot. Her hobby is gardening, and she devotes her spare time to protecting her garden by weeding the dorm's backyard. She goes on walks in the middle of the night to count the stars whenever she is upset, something she has been doing ever since she was a little girl. Because of her youthful appearance, she is often treated like a child, unbecoming of her status as a teacher. Lately, she has been spending more and more time looking up at the sky from the dorm's backyard.Sakura KirishimaThe class representative and cool beauty in the next seat over. When the other Fine Arts Club members protested Tohru's entry into the club, all it took was for Sakura to say, “I will take responsibility,” to convert them into unanimously approving.At Rintoku Academy, which is already renowned for its art programs, the Fine Arts Club stands above the rest. And Sakura is the only person capable of wrangling the prideful members of the Fine Arts Club into working, to the point that three club advisors have lost confidence and quit in the past year. Despite only being the vice president of the club, her words’ influence rivals that of the teachers', and she is not taken lightly by anyone.That is the reason why, when Tohru naturally lines his up desk with Sakura’s to share textbooks or when he invites her to eat lunch together, their classmates get restless. However, as Sakura is the only person who can get the problem children of the Tsukimi dorm to fall into line, she is also the only one capable of being their class representative. Her natural leadership dwarfs Nanako’s, who is still a novice teacher, causing the latter to often feel discouraged.Sakura dislikes people who are spineless, waste words, or can't keep promises, those of whom greatly outnumber the people she likes. Despite Tohru being all of these, she becomes his guardian when it comes to club activities, looking out for him. But what her clubmates understand least of all is why she gets so fired up when it comes to the Tsukimi dorm mother, Nanako. The two often collide in a rivalry over teaching Tohru about the academy's customs.Akira NittaThe real-life childhood friend who finds the idea of an Internet childhood friend ridiculous. Akira dreamed about marrying Naoki when she was a little girl, earnestly devoting herself to him and spoiling him... and then doing a complete 180 when she realized he had turned into a sloth because of her. Her current number one wish is to erase those years of puppy-love devotion from her memory.Just as Naoki managed to enroll in Rintoku through the kendo program, Akira enrolled through its gymnastics program and thus also lives in Tsukimi dorm. For reasons unknown, she no longer attends practice and instead skips to play baseball and table tennis with Naoki. Whenever he asks her why she keeps skipping with him, she simply replies, ""Why don’t you ask the leotard?""To Akira, Kurumi doesn't even register as a rival. However, when Kurumi drags Naoki into conversations about Internet games and dating sims, she becomes determined to steer him away, beginning another hopeless battle for his affection.Akira follows a strict day-to-day diet and is afraid of body weight scales. She often says, ""I wish my stomach would stay closer to my back."" She is also obsessed with household appliances and has spent the last six months steadily saving to buy a cute refrigerator. Her favorite food is popsicles and her dream is to have a refrigerator stocked year-round with perfect rows of sparkling popsicles.Kurumi TachibanaThe Internet childhood friend who refuses to lose to a real-life childhood friend. Six years ago, HALLO made huge waves among hardcore gamers as one of the first big MMORPGs. Kurumi and Naoki met there and formed a party, shedding blood, sweat, and tears together for more than two years. However, right before they could clear the final dungeon, the game ceased operations and the two were suddenly forced apart. Kurumi had planned to confess to him and ask for his contact information once they cleared it, but it seemed her first love was not to be.All she knew was that Naoki lived in the same region as her. Kurumi was a shut-in at the time, but she took that day as an opportunity to change. She learned how to be fashionable, took up more club activities, started studying, and became an outgoing person. She had no intention of letting her first love end the way it did.Two years Naoki's junior, Kurumi was recognized as a genius for the sensitivity portrayed in her art and rose to the top of the Rintoku Academy affiliate school she attended, allowing her to take part in the Rintoku Academy Fine Arts Club’s activities. Through Tohru, she recognized Naoki as the person she had been looking for and, consequently, has started picking fights with Naoki's real-life childhood friend, Akira. However, she gets nervous and loses her ability to speak in front of Naoki, resorting to extremely formal language. When she played HALLO with him, she lacked the courage to confess outright and instead kept wandering around the entrance to the final dungeon.",Minimum:OS: Windows 98+Processor: Pentium III 500 MHz or higherMemory: 256 MB RAMGraphics: On-Board GPUStorage: 7 GB available space,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,64400,28000,44500,0,84800

Their mission takes them straight into the heart of the Rhombus of Ruin—a mysterious part of the ocean as deadly as two Bermuda Triangles back to back!<br />
<br />
When the rescue party itself is kidnapped and held prisoner in the Rhombus, Raz is immobilized and must use only his psychic powers to reunite his friends, reveal the identity of the kidnapper, and free Truman before the madness of the Rhombus consumes all their minds.","Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 SP1 or greaterProcessor: Intel i5-4590 processor equivalent or greaterMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD 290 equivalent or greaterStorage: 8 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Gamepad required, Touch as Gamepad optional",Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,47400,95400,60000,95000,41100

After a long year of treatment without any positive results, Yuuki asks for his final wish: to return to his hometown and fulfill his promise to meet again with his childhood friend, Saki Nishimura. However, as always, things are hard for him.  Saki no longer lives where she used to, and no one knows her whereabouts. The last hint Yuuki got was from the high school Saki had said she wanted to attend—Shimizu High School.

262,436690,Tempest Citadel,Aartform Games,Indie/Simulation/Strategy,"Apr 17, 2018","Tempest Citadel is a strategy game set on a storm-ruled planet in which sci-fi and fantasy collide. Assume the role of an enigmatic Captain from Terra, whose past and future are yours to shape, as he embarks on a mission to explore a deadly world that promises wondrous and terrible power.But you are not the first to come.Armies of ruthless enemies hide within the clouds, hungry for the blood of the weak and the foolish. From gene-spliced psychics to cyborg dark-mages, other factions have claimed the ancient sites which hold the technological marvels you seek.Can you build, grow, and risk enough to stand against your enemies? Will you forego mercy against those who would show you none? Do you have what it takes to fight for control of this world and claim the secrets of the ancient dead race that once ruled it?Your mission was a lie. Your first moments waking from cryostasis bear this revelation, and you find yourself in a corner of the cosmos that you know nothing about. Only one thing is clear: those that sent you knew full well what they were doing.Beneath you, a planet sleeps imprisoned by the planet-wide storm ruling its surface. What you're after – your true mission and your only way home – hides deep under those rage-fuelled clouds. And the price of ultimate power is always the most dear.Tempest Citadel sees you building a city in the clouds, module by module, and leading 100 unique crew members into action, be they Soldiers, Scavengers, Workers, Researchers, or Medical Experts. You pick their role, their training, their equipment.The primary goal is to explore the surface. You start by scanning and picking sites to send expeditions to, using any intel you can find to pick the best squad for the terrain, weather, and opposing forces. Preparation is vital; once your squad lands, the battle plays out automatically.This is what makes Tempest Citadel a Grand Strategy game – a genre that infuses RTS with high-level, long-term tactical play. Plan your attack, set up your soldiers, and release them onto the battlefield as if it were one long pull of a gun trigger. Then watch the hammer breathe fire and send the silver bullet flying as your squad unleashes havoc.Survival means conquest, so a big focus of research and production is optimising your attack squad and your city defences. With a full array of Sci-Fi weapons, armour, and augmentations, you can make anything from Bio-Enhanced Super Soldiers, to Exosuit-Wearing Assault Troopers, or even Psychic Stormweavers. Ultimately, choosing the right tool for the job is essential to victory; the right squad design can often overcome sheer strength in numbers.With a large crew to manage, you have options to auto-equip based on a role, such as ""Assault Runner"", ""Skirmisher"", or ""Sniper"". When you resupply with new weapons and armour, your crewmembers choose the best for their role.Successful missions can yield research data, such as blueprints and schematics, as well as scrap and tech items. Back at the city, these are vital to unlocking the 200+ node research trees, and constructing 170+ modules, items, and weapons.Missions will also have a cost, both material and human. If your soldiers fall in battle, you can bring them back with all kinds of technology - but they might lose their humanity in the process.Your progress on the planet is beaten back by 5 enemy factions, each with their own troops, tech specialities, strengths, weaknesses, and storylines. Overcoming them is no easy feat. Further, the day-to-day running of the city is interrupted by tactical and social dilemmas that lead to great risks – but also to lucrative opportunities.Aartform Games' previous Steam releases include the empire building economics sim Spice Road and a fun sculpting program Curvy 3D---What lost secrets lay hidden beneath the eons-old storms?

271,682480,the untold story of hengshui school,橙光游戏,Adventure/Casual/Indie/RPG/Simulation/Strategy,"Apr 16, 2018","The Untold Story of Hengshui School is a detective game which sets on Hengshui high school, a top notch middle high around the country, also called “straight A student camp” in which most of the students have entered great universities after graduation. However, what behind this glamorous legend was a “huge skeleton in the closet”. A student named Shen Jige killed himself by jumping of the building. A “lame” police officer Song Tianqi and two students, Li Musha and He Mina, start an investigation on the case. Unexpectedly, this appeared suicide is just the beginning of a shocking conspiracy…<br />
<br />
The theme of this game reflects a social problem in China: the examination-oriented educating system which constantly ignores the individual differences and hobbies, focusing on grades instead of social skills, and has no respect for student privacy.<br />
Students are holding on to a philosophy that score is superior than their own emotions and freedom.<br />
<br />
Key Features:<br />
<br />
Black humor, realism, and AVG. You’ll have to investigate each incident, search for clues, and talk to all involved people to try and unravel the mystery of each case! <br />
<br />
Murders and detective thriller! But not the “cult film” kind of type. Silly humor and mediocre difficulty are suitable for every player.<br />
<br />
<br />
Collecting Evidence:<br />
Collect evidence by many methods like talking with characters and answering questions. Keep in mind that some characters have special personalities. They are willing to tell you information only after you know their hobbies and experiences.<br />
<br />
Series of Counterattack Mode:<br />
An extremely complicated puzzle will trigger the series of counterattack mode on, in which you can notice the subtlest details that are neglected by most people and discover the shocking truth behind the seemingly simple cases.<br />
<br />
Test Score System:<br />
HP bar is replaced by a test score system---you answer wrong, your test score drops. Once your test score is below 60, you will fail the test and no longer be able to unlock the ending. Feel the wrath of bad students!<br />
<br />
“Stupid” Questions:<br />
Once your test score is below 60 yet you are not willing to restart the whole game, you have the option of answering Principle Cat’s “stupid” questions, which cover many important knowledge points from high school subjects including Chinese, math, history, biology, etc. Some of the questions even can be found in the college entrance exams(Gaokao) in real life, and the answers contain many “Chinese features” as well.","Minimum:OS: windowsXP,Vista,7,8,10Processor: 1Ghz or faster processorMemory: 512 MB RAMGraphics: 512MB VRAMStorage: 1 GB available space","Recommended:OS: windowsXP,Vista,7,8,10Processor: 2Ghz or faster processorGraphics: 1GB VRAMStorage: 1 GB available space",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,32700,70100,80000,0,14300

306,792670,The Woods,Moonware Games,Violent/Gore/Action/Casual/Simulation/Strategy/Early Access,Apr 2018,"Lost deep in the woods - but not alone!“The Woods” is an ambient psycho horror game, which let the player experience a mad rush about life or death. Lost in a dark forest, you crossed the lines into the hunting grounds of a ruthless killer. Escape - or say goodbye forever!The ScenarioIt was late at night already, when suddenly an in blood covered shape lights up in the beam of your car headlights, starring right at you. As the breaks fail you turn hard to the right in a natural reflex.The last you remember is the crash into a tree in the nearby forest. Now trapped, you steal your way through the woods and fight for your life because you are not alone.""The Woods"" creates with realistic features an intense atmosphere. Horror fans can be excited about a procedurally generated scenario, decision-based gameplay, and a cold ambient, with a chance of a lot of creeps. In an area of 12 square kilometers, every single movement decides about life or death and every interaction can bring you closer to escape or impede it.The surrounding nature creates a breathtaking and oppressive feeling. Was this blurry shape in the fog game creeping around, a tree bending by the wind or worst, was it your tormentor?The sounds and voice of the forest are pushing you forward. Just pray that the crackling behind you is not a bad omen.GameplayTo survive, you need to come through the night and find a way out of the woods, something that sounds easier than it is! The killer as nature is able to hurt you, slow you down or to irritate you and send you on the wrong path and into the next trap. If you want to survive, you need to develop your own approach. Sneak and stay in the dark or try to escape with fast sprints and fight bravely against your pursuer. In „The Woods“ every single way or decision is neither wrong nor right. Your strategy is growing with your success and failures over time.The game is analyzing your style of playing during your experience and is changing itself to your personal nightmare. Some interesting spots in the level are changing their appearance, fresh or even rotten corpses are appearing all over the woods. Sometimes trees and other plants can fall or get hit by lighting and catch fire which can cut off essential routes for your escape.Also, the killer can adapt his strategy to your behavior and change his usual path, to find and attack you more efficient.With every new game round, essential spots in level are changing, which makes it almost impossible to remember ways, items or hiding spots again and again. Especially useful weapons and items can even not be available. Also, the killer is changing in every new round. In that case, the game experience is depending mostly on which one of the possible killer is hunting you, which abilities he has and which ways he knows.Key FeaturesReal Fear – The game is based on a game experience close to reality what can cause real fear and an oppressive feeling for the player. Instead of ungainly jumpscares, the horror of the unknown expects you here. Wild animals running away all of a sudden, the creak of the branches in the wind and the continual certainty, not to be alone, give real creeps.YOUR heartbeat – To get out everything of the game experience, the player can transfer his real pulse with the help of a heart rate monitor into the game and on the character. The game will adapt itself to the (un)well-being of the player with possibly disastrous results. Attention: Nothing for weak nerves.Interactions with the environment – Running away is not the only means for a succeeding escape. Use nature and benefit from it to win time. Every stone, tree or bush can be a potential hiding spot. Throw stones to deflect the killer or to lead him on the wrong track. Climb on a rock, raised hides or other objects and look at your way from above – but attention your character gets tired after some time and drives the risk to fall. A fall can go well but also entail massive osseous breaks or the death.Own Decisions – How and where to flee, are not the only questions you have to deal with. If you get in captivity of the killer, you can get confronted with cruel decisions. Do you sacrifice, for example, an arm or do you join in his mad little psycho games? The choice lies with you – but can you live with the consequences?Get lost! – The surroundings are procedurally generated in a natural way close to the reality. In the deep woods, it is almost impossible to find ways and places again. Every new game round changes the level and in it contained (or not contained) items and weapons, as well as important locations.Self-Learning AI – The killer changes his personality and learns new abilities over time. He adapts himself to the behavior, the movement and reaction of the player. This makes „The Woods“ to an always unique, unpredictable and challenging game experience.Wild animals – Not only the killer hunts after you. In the woods creep around wild animals, like bear and wolves who could jump out of the darkness anytime and attack the player. Preys like deer, roe deer and crows take the flight if you approach them, and their noises can lead the killer to you. So keep your eyes open!Watch your steps! – The woods are against you. You can trip over stones and trunks or step in puddles and on branches. Footprints on wet forest ground lead the killer to you, and set traps can hurt or kill you.Secrets – The game world of ""The Woods"" contain many helpful and interesting secrets. There is no need to search them, but they could give you essential advantages to survive.",Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows Vista (x64)Processor: AMD A4-6210 APU with AMD Radeon R3 Graphics 1.80GHzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: AMD Radeon™ R3 GraphicsDirectX: Version 10Storage: 6 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: To play the game with this requirements you need to set the graphic settings to LOW,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 (x64)Processor: Intel i7-7700HQ @2.80GHz or similarMemory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GTX 1080 4GB or similarDirectX: Version 11Storage: 6 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: For the best game experience and high graphic settings,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,15900,25600,29900,0,22100

Otherwise, you can Hack into another players' dungeon adventure, playing as the most intelligent and powerful monster they have ever met, ultimately letting them taste the bitterest failure.Dueling Dungeon is a traditional rouge-like action game, but at the same time, it is a fierce tournament.So what are you supposed to be able to do in this game?Dueling Dungeon is basically an action/ combat game.

When you start the game you'll be placed inside a tavern, and from there you can start a dungeon adventure with only one life. Each of the 10 dungeons is dynamically generated. In each room, you'll face a random enemy monster or randomly-matched human player. You advance by continually defeating challengers—otherwise, you will return to the tavern after being beaten. After finishing the adventure you will get a reward.If you are not willing to do such a long series of adventure, you can choose to play as a protector in another players' 10-room challenge. You would not only play as your own fighter, but also you can chose your contender from a variety of monsters.

The Place: Heldentod P.O.W. Camp<br />
The Mission: Escape.<br />
<br />
Captured, but not defeated, you are being held in the notorious Heldentod camp. This small, converted castle in the middle of nowhere will be your home for the rest of the war; unless you can escape to rejoin the Allied Armies. Planning, patience, skill, and courage will be necessary as you gather your resources, make  your plans, and finally, make your great escape.<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
<br />
•Dynamic Scrolling 3D Isometric Graphics<br />
•Multiple escape paths with multiple solutions<br />
•Guards, the Commandant, and fellow prisoners to hinder and help your plans<br />
•Action, danger, excitement, logic and cunning combined in a unforgettable experience<br />
<br />
The Great Escape is an isometric action-adventure game. Controlling a prisoner of war in a German camp, your goal is to break out undetected. There are numerous ways to freedom – back doors, cracked fences, even underground tunnels. However, you have to plan your escape while obeying the strict rules of the camp. <br />
<br />
Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these events will result in the alarm being rung. When you do not touch the controls, your protagonist will move automatically, going to all important events. You have to detect and use gaps in the time-table to explore the camp. <br />
<br />
Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. <br />
<br />
Rule number three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find keys to open locked doors, uniforms for camouflage, flashlights to see in dark tunnels, and many more. <br />
<br />
Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn the guard’s routes and sneak past their backs to avoid detection when breaking out. If you are caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.v","Minimum:OS: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10Processor: Pentium 4Memory: 256 MB RAMGraphics: Athlon 64 or laterStorage: 256 MB available space",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,67100,47400,31300,0,67900
343,814640,Sleepwalker,Ocean Software,Adventure/Strategy,"Apr 13, 2018","Lee is having a restless night, sure he's fast asleep, but that won't stop him taking on of his nocturnal journeys! Fortunately, our sleepwalker has a courageous canine companion who will try his utmost to protect his master from coming to any harm; Lee's faithful mutt, Ralph.<br />
<br />
Lee's four legged friend is zapped, bashed, clobbered, pummeled singed and squashed, but nothing will stop him from performing his dedicated duty, (although the odd fire hydrant may distract him)... it's all par for the course of a night errand.<br />
<br />
These midnight meanderings take him to the most hazardous of places...the creepy graveyard, the gooky zoo, precarious construction sites and the traffic strewn city streets, but Lee's loyal rover steadfastly guards his master from all impending dangers, with painful consequences! <br />
<br />
Featuring sound effects and speech created by Lenny Henry, and superb cartoon style animation.<br />
<br />
The game centres on a boy called Lee and his faithful dog Ralph. We're introduced to Lee from the dog's perspective after waking up to find his owner sleepwalking through his bedroom window. Ralph leaps after him and the player then takes control of what happens next.<br />
<br />
Throughout the game Lee will relentlessly walk in the direction he is facing, the problem is there are objects and pitfalls in his path that can ultimately wake him up or even kill him. The player can monitor Lee's sleep level with a bar at the top of the screen. If the bar reaches zero, Lee wakes up and the player loses a life. If this happens three (or five depending on settings) times the game is lost.<br />
<br />
The player controls Ralph the dog in order to manipulate either Lee, or the objects he is likely to walk into, to see him safely to the end of a level. The frequency of these pitfalls increases as each level progresses and, as it does, the player has to spend more time strategically neutralising threats, far in advance of Lee's actual position in the level.<br />
<br />
Although it is possible for Lee to die, resulting in a loss of life and restart of the level for the player, Ralph is invincible, surviving otherwise fatal incidents with comedic effect.<br />
<br />
If all the levels are successfully completed Lee finally returns to his bed and crawls back in.","Minimum:OS: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10Processor: Pentium 4Memory: 256 MB RAMGraphics: Athlon 64 or laterStorage: 256 MB available space",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,79500,17500,68900,0,27500

<br />
The game consists of 100 levels of increasing complexity over nine different themed worlds. Each level features several interconnected platforms holding a number of &quot;dominoes&quot;. The aim is to rearrange the dominoes, such that with a single push, all of the dominoes are toppled, thus opening the exit to the next level. There are 11 different types of domino, identified by red and yellow patterns, each with different actions. The player controls G.I. Ant, who can move certain dominoes by carrying them one at a time.<br />
<br />
Various factors can result in failure to complete a level. As well as toppling all of the dominoes, the player must be able to access the exit door once the dominoes have fallen. For instance, the player will be unable to reach the exit if a ledge leading to the exit has been destroyed, or if a gap leading to the exit has not been bridged, or if a line of dominoes lie across the exit. G.I. Ant may die by falling from a large height, by falling off the bottom of the screen, or by being crushed under a falling domino. The player is then greeted with the message &quot;You Failed, You Died&quot; and has to restart the level. Also, the level will be failed if any dominoes are destroyed by landing one domino on top of another.<br />
<br />
Each level has a time limit during which it must be completed. However, if the time runs out the player is still able to continue with the puzzle if they wish. By pausing the game once the time has run out, a small hint will be displayed, giving advice on how to complete the level. As a side note, the hint for level 98 informs the player that the game's designer cannot remember how to complete the level without trickery (&quot;Use a drop! There is a way to make it work with a push, but I can't find it!&quot;).","Minimum:OS: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10Processor: Pentium 4Memory: 256 MB RAMGraphics: Athlon 64 or later",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,10600,37700,53400,0,68100

However, an evil creature known as Necrilous the Not-Very-Nice kidnapped Elisa and disappeared with her. Cornelius must embark on a perilous journey to rescue the love of his life.<br />
<br />
To reach her, you must traverse enchanted woods, underground mines, jungle swamps, and snow-capped peaks, where bizarre, villainous creatures and devious puzzles will test your mettle every step of the way! <br />
<br />
Fortunately, your magic ring can cast many spells, increasing in power as you tread deeper into the mystical lands of goons, goblins, and demons. You can even control some of the background game features, helping you get to where you think you should be. Numerous secret areas lie deep within the forest, where vital clues can aid your quest, but beware ... you own ghost may materialize to haunt you!<br />
<br />
Elf is a platform action game with light adventure elements. Cornelius is armed with a ring that fires projectiles at enemies. During the course of the game he can collect herbs and animals (called &quot;pets&quot;), which can be traded in shops for upgrades such as stronger attacks, extra speed, magic spells, or devices such as a flying machine. In addition, certain segments require the player to communicate with NPCs populating the game world and fulfill their requests, usually by obtaining specific items for them. <br />
<br />
The game keeps track of the player character's behavior, assigning the player a rating and affecting the ending scene depending on the protagonist's actions, which mainly involve killing or sparing the lives of the game's non-hostile characters. The protagonist's health is measured in hearts and lives, which can be replenished or increased.

Just before he runs out of air, he sees a light and finds himself in a strange world ruled by monster girls. In this world he encounters three of them, one after the other.

Experience a majestic tide of fish.<br />
Amigo Fishing is a VR game about hunting for fish in the deep sea. The game is set in a mysterious deep-sea region bursting with coral and aquatic life.<br />
In the game, you can choose different equipment and weapons and use different kinds of ammunition. While fishing you can charge up your energy gun, and when the king of the ocean is stirred, a huge wave of fish will surge out, after which you can use your assassin’s sword to collect a whole boatful of fish. When you hear the loud call of the giant whale, prepare to face your destiny…<br />
<br />
How to play<br />
<br />
Every fisherman is equipped with two special weapons. The weapons will upgrade as they are used and unlock other accessory slots. Via upgrading weapons, completing missions and catching certain kinds of fish, the player can gain access to special accessories. By combining various different accessories you can create your own fishing strategies suited to your own playstyle, to increase your skill at fishing in general or to target certain kinds of fish in particular.<br />
<br />
The game features over twenty different kinds of fish. Each fish is unique in terms of appearance, speed, difficulty to catch and other special characteristics. Some can be caught head on, while others form groups which you can capture all at once if you cast your net from the side. More exciting fishing tactics await you when you visit this mysterious and bountiful deep-sea region.",Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7Processor: intel i5-4590，AMD FX 8350Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060DirectX: Version 10Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 1 GB available space,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7Processor: intel i5-4590Memory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070DirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 2 GB available space,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,33000,92900,16900,0,0

It’s going to be different, because it’s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let’s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other’s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out – the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone – they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That’s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.<br />
<br />
What makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities – she can run fast, he can sneak – but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities. You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside. Together, there’s nothing in the world that can stop you.<br />

Matthew Milson - Puddledock GamesStarships are made up of individual components called 'Star-Chips'. They are the guts of the ship: thrusters, laser guns, shields, etc. They can be placed in whatever arrangement you want. Once your ship is designed, you are placed in the Star-Pit to battle enemy starships and put your creation to the ultimate test. As chips on the ship are destroyed, the ship loses whatever functionality they provided. Earn points and Graps for destroying enemies starships chip-by-chip and spend those hard earned funds on your next starship. Enemy ships get increasingly more difficult the longer you last in the pit. Also there's space mines. Watch out for those.Easy to learn controls (not a twin stick shooter)Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepad supportSteam AchievementsSteam LeaderboardSteam Cloud supportInfinite replayabilityA dozen different ship modules to construct a starship to suit any strategy",Minimum:OS: Windows 10Processor: Dual Core +Memory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 512MB +Storage: 5 MB available space,Recommended:OS: Windows 10Processor: Dual Core +Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: 512MB +Storage: 5 MB available space,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,59000,56400,0,0,0

Defeat hordes of enemies, from foot soldiers to mighty dragons, to make your way through a mysterious tower that appeared out of nowhere. Discover its secrets and stop the evil Scak from accomplishing his plan that would seal Interia's fate.General GameplaySuncore Chronicles: The Tower mixes several genres to give a fresh and unique gameplay experience. Beside classical action adventure elements like puzzle solving, minigames, combat and looting in a third person setting, the game also includes several other gameplay elements. Those involve platforming sections with 2D movement or ""Beat em up"" styled levels, which are influenced by the good old console or arcade classics.Combat SystemSuncore Chronicles: The Tower has a fast paced realtime combat system, focussing on dodging enemy abilities, crowd control and using your strong abilities if the timing and positioning allows for it. The numerous bosses require the player to figure out the mechanics and timings to be able to succeed. The game also includes special dungeons meant for group play, which can require a whole group of four players to coordinate their actions in a reasonable way.Specializations and SkillsThe player can change between four different specializations at any time in the game, which include two melee classes and two more range oriented caster classes. Each class has their own abilities, which can be learned throughout the game. Abilities can be leveled up to increase their strength and add additional perks. In addition, each class has a specific strength like inceased health or a higher chance to perform critical strikes.Equipment SystemEach enemy in the game can drop loot of different kind and quality, including armor, weapons, materials for upgrades, runes, recipes for runewords and more. The player can save all of his equipment in sets, which (like the specialization) can be changed at any time to fit the current play style. High quality pieces of equipment can modify player abilities, proc certain effects or even form powerful sets.Development PhilosophyThe base version of the game is free to play, allowing the player to get to know the main features and feeling of the game. However, the world is restricted to the starting areas, including two tutorial sections and the first world regions.

477,568220,Lobotomy Corporation | Monster Management Simulation,Project Moon,Indie/Simulation,"Apr 9, 2018"," Administrator and monsters, you cannot possibly imagine.  Lobotomy Corp is a Monster Management Rogue-Lite Simulation game.Our game was inspired by the monsters from game and movies such as SCP series, Cabin in the woods and Warehouse 13. Furthermore, it was developed from the thought of “What if those monsters were real and your job is to manage them”. You will be playing as an administrator of the company which is in the management of such creatures. These monsters generate a new energy source, and your job is to collect them through giving out to your subordinates. Through this process, you can open new departments that facility allows and encounter various monsters. In the game, the player will have to go through the company’s fear and tension filled the atmosphere. “Our new technology will bring salvation to the human race.” Lobotomy corporation is a newly established energy company that extracts an infinite amount of entropy through the isolation of abnormality with our self-developed technology. This is only an impression that the public has regarding our company. You will see its reality after you have joined us.Our facility is formed of many departments just like any other companies. You will have access to various departments as you gather more energy. The more you have access to various departments, the much easier the management of abnormality will become.Furthermore, an AI ‘Angela’ and ‘Sephira’ will be by your side to support your needs for the smooth process of work. An existence you constantly have to examine and observe. We have decided to call the monsters in Lobotomy as ‘Abnormality’.You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while keeping the energy extraction level at its maximum.At first, you won’t have any information on Abnormality. You will only have your eyes and the manual to guide you. Speculate which process will be most suitable for each Abnormality. After that, just pick and place your employee who is best suited for the job and wait for results. Also, you will have to gather information through giving out orders to your employees to ‘examine’ the creature. You get the power to obtain information in the process of managing Abnormality.Abnormality’s energy generation level depends on their conditions This game is NOT a tycoon.As mentioned before, Abnormality is a creature that should be handled with an extreme alert. Some of them might don’t like the idea of humans keeping them locked up in chambers. They will try to escape when they have a chance and when they do, they will destroy everything. Be it our employees or the facility.Furthermore, certain Abnormality can brainwash and corrupt our employees into their pawn. These ‘pawns’ can have a bad effect on other employees and might randomly attack the people around them. Also, they also bring down the other employees’ mentality level which might result in disobedience. You could get rid them of course, but you should consider the fact that all the information and data regarding that employee will be deleted as well. One disaster will cause another, and it will lead everything into chaos.If you do not stop them instantly, the situation will get out of hand and fall into chaos. When this situation does occur, you will have to decide whether you will gather employees to recapture the Abnormality, or destroy some part of the facility with explosives to secure the company’s safety. “Do you have any wishes, administrator?” Lobotomy corporation is divided into work procedure and the story mode. In work procedure, you will be doing your job as the company’s administrator managing the Abnormality and the energy generation level. A game’s story will follow right afterward. In Story mode, there is a dialogue with Sephira, including AI Angela, which will also appear in the work part. Through the mission they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden in the company. Furthermore, the player will be placed in a situation where they must answer or ask questions. You can also discover secrets surrounding the company and the player.","Minimum:OS: Windows 8.1 or laterProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3570Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: 1280x768 minimum resolution, DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics cardDirectX: Version 9.0cStorage: 6 GB available spaceSound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,59100,28300,18800,87100,70200

<br />
In the winter of 1967, a young man enters out of the snowy night into a bar in the sleepy town of Cedar on the northern frontier of Maine. He takes off his gloves and rubs his hands together. He slips out a golden pocket watch from inside his coat, checks the time, and gently places it back. Closing his tired eyes, he stops to think. <br />
<br />
He is a wanderer cursed with eternal youth, sent out by fate forever to roam the world, never to find a home.<br />
<br />
The bartender approaches him when he takes a seat and he pays for a drink so he can stay. The liquid in the glass shines slick like oil under the dim lights of the bar. Warmth fills the wanderer as he downs it in one gulp. After that he sits awhile to rest but knows he can't stay. Just as he gets up to leave, he notices something happening in the corner of the room.<br />

496,772650,R.A.F.A.,Cristian Villalba,Action/Adventure/Indie,"Apr 6, 2018","R.A.F.A. is a 3rd person view platformer happening in a solar system. <br />
<br />
Explore, jump, shoot and have some fun across space<br />
<br />
You control an astronaut, he starts the game by appearing on a particular planet.<br />
The planets have two different types of fuel (blue and green) and are distributed randomly on each half of a planet each.<br />
A single type of fuel is not very useful, it is required to accumulate both to give some use to it.<br />
Fuel may be used to use a sort of railgun (sorry quake) and / or to power the astronaut jetpack.<br />
So it is understood that you can freely explore the planet, dodging enemies and collecting score, and / or you can use the fuel acquired to try to travel to another planet.<br />
I mean “try” because fuel is not abundant and may not be enough to reach another planet. As the solar system is dynamic one must be cautious and try to wait for the moment your planet and your destination get as close as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
What sets this project apart?<br />
	- Indie development<br />
	- Gameplay across an entire solar system (generated procedurally)<br />
	- Sort of 16 bit Arcade style but in 3D.<br />
<br />
2 types of games modes, time attack and story mode.<br />
•	In time attack you will challenge yourself to explore all planets as quick as possible.<br />
•	In story mode you will find a new friend that will help you revealing mysteries around you.<br />
<br />
Important regarding gameplay:<br />
R.A.F.A. is really simple, one button to shoot and one to jump....and if you maintain the jump for a while you will activate the jetpack.<br />

Welcome to a future where the spectacle of fiery gib-deaths no longer satisfies the hungry, salivating audiences of flabby flesh bags watching from home. Fortunately the sport of PWND has rocketed to the rescue, entertaining luddites of tomorrow with spectacular displays of corpse defiling domination.In PWND, the kill is just the beginning. In order to score, you must pwn by performing a close range victory dance on your downed opponents. But be careful! You’re completely vulnerable during your victory dance, so make sure your team’s got your back or you'll find yourself on the wrong end of a pwn stack. Situational awareness and team communication are critical for pulling major PWNage. Teamwork becomes ever more important as the stakes get higher and higher over the course of a match.

Each character has their own set of skills for you to master on the road to victory.  The action doesn't stop when your opponent is crawling and wheezing their last pitiful breath. What fun is that? Big scores come from the PWN, a display of weaponized disrespect atop prone opponents. Rub it in, but be careful: strategy and teamwork are required lest you lose the war.Swagger baby, it’s all about smooth buttery style in this throwdown town.

It was a lot of work to make new things out of everything I developed. There were a lot of accidents during development, but I am very happy and proud to release this.I hope you like it.If you give us a lack of points or feedback while you play, we will actively try to develop it into a better game.Thank you. A childhood story I have been impressed with Cave Story during my junior high school days and have developed the dream of game developers.Can I make a game like this? I used to ask myself the question of the rough and delicate Cave Story graphics. That's why you may feel the same atmosphere in my game.If you compare Sacred Stones with the Cave Story, it's a small game, but I think it's my first step.In the future, I will make a more unique and fun game with my own color. Thank you for your support until then. by Sungjun Jo (NOXBIX)안녕하세요. NOXBIX의 게임 디렉터이자 개발자 Sungjun Jo 입니다. Sacred Stones 는 제가 고등학생 때부터 혼자 개발하던 게임입니다.처음부터 높은 목표를 잡고 시작했지만, 제 자신과 타협하지 않고 목표한 대로 만들었다고 생각합니다. 개발한 것들을 다 버리고 새로 다 만드는 일도 허다했습니다. 개발 중간 중간 사건사고도 많았지만 무사히 출시하게 되어 정말 기쁘고 뿌듯합니다.유저 여러분의 마음에 들었으면 좋겠습니다.플레이 하시면서 부족한 점이나 피드백을 주시면 적극 반영해 더욱더 좋은 게임으로 발전시킬 수 있도록 노력하겠습니다. 감사합니다.어릴 적 이야기중학생 시절 Cave Story 를 감명 깊게 플레이하고 게임 개발자의 꿈을 키워 왔습니다. 나도 이런 게임을 만들 수 있을까? 라는 질문을 제 자신에게 던졌고 거칠고 섬세한 Cave Story 의 그래픽을 무작정 따라 그려보곤 했습니다. 이 때문에 제 게임에서 동일한 분위기가 풍기는 것 같습니다Sacred Stones 를 Cave Story 옆에 두고 비교하면 한없이 작은 게임이지만 이것으로 첫계단을 오른 게 아닐까 생각합니다. 앞으로 저만의 색깔로 좀 더 독특하고 즐거운 게임을 만들겠습니다. 그때까지 많은 응원 부탁드립니다. 감사합니다.by Sungjun Jo(NOXBIX)","Minimum:OS: Windows XP, Vista, 7, or laterProcessor: 64bit Intel compatible Dual Core CPUMemory: 2048 MB RAMGraphics: DX11 compliant graphics cardDirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 30 MB available space",Not supported,Minimum:OS: Mavericks (OSX 10.9) OS or above.Processor: Intel chipset,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,51000,79300,85000,0,0
555,644640,Band of Defenders,Alda Games,Violent/Gore/Action,"Apr 5, 2018","Band of Defenders is a modern online CO-OP FPS game where up to four players protect one central object against masses of savages and mutants who rule the world, which is slowly recovering from nuclear apocalypse. Players build, repair and upgrade barricades and turrets, craft weapons and try to survive waves of enemies.Each game consists of a few waves of enemies and the players have time to build their defenses after they deal with each wave. The last wave is always lead by one of the enemy bosses, highly dangerous individuals that will test your defenses and skills to the fullest.First of all, we wanted to create a fun shooter game that has everything players expect and desire. Tons of different weapons, fluid animations and a good feeling from shooting bad guys. And because Band of Defenders is a cooperative game, you can play it solo, with friends or with complete strangers — it is completely up to you how you want to enjoy your game. The world of Band of Defenders is also extremely brutal, so make sure you can handle a little bit of bloodshed.Do you like survival games where you have to build defenses to survive attacks from savage enemies? We love those but we think that it takes too much time to play, for example, 7 Days to Die and really enjoy it. Band of Defenders comes with a similar idea but it's focused on shorter (around 20-30 minutes) individual battles. You start only with a basic equipment but you fortify your stand to beat more and more dangerous waves of enemies and beat the boss that comes at you in the end.You build various barricades and automated turrets, craft weapons, set minefields to protect vulnerable spots and prepare for the worst, which always comes.You get experience points after each battle and, by leveling up, you get a crate with some useful equipment – new guns to craft, new upgrades to your turrets, new barricades to build, perks that give you a better gun on a better start of each game, etc. So, a higher level means more and better equipment and a higher chance to survive, especially if you want to play on higher difficulties.Are you ready for one of the best visual customization experiences you can have in online shooters? Without buying keys to actually get items you rightfully won? Band of Defenders lets you customize all characters without trying to rob you. You just have to win a game, get your new items and try to figure out what combination of visual items give you the best looks. From character skins, headwear and face accessories to cool armors and knife skins, ranging from regular items to crazy ones, you will have almost an infinite number of combinations so your character will be unique.You are a mercenary, member of the elite group Band of Defenders. You came from the vaults deep under the destroyed surface of the Earth and you want to reclaim what is rightfully yours. However, the world is still a very hostile place, with the Cult of Gore uniting mutants and savage bandits into the horde that is the main power that kills, pillages and stops any attempts to start the human civilization anew.That means a lot of work for you and your fellow mercenaries. Take pride in protecting the remnants of what once was a decent human society (so decent that it eventually destroyed the world with nukes...). Only you are able to defend the weak and the wealthy against hazards of this new deadly world.Band of Defenders is packed with content and action for you to enjoy each minute of the many hours you will be playing30+ weapons including pistols, assault rifles, grenade launchers, mines, grenades and some more futuristic pieces, such as laser or tesla rifles65+ buildings (3 unique barricade types, 4 unique turret types and special structures like the gun nest or ""door"") to build 10+ enemies ranging from expendable bandits trying to punch you to elite mutants in heavy armor and mortar in hand4+ maps in various post-apocalyptic sceneries3+ enemy bosses that will test your defenses at the end of each battle4 difficulties that come not only with scaling of enemy stats but also with completely new sets of waves of enemies that will be attacking you3+ characters to choose from — do you see yourself as valorous soldier, a sexy woman lieutenant or a huge mutant that switched sides and fights against his own?200+ items for visual customization — hats, face accessories, armors, character skins, knife skins and modelsEndless mode: protect yourself against waves of enemies — the next one always stronger than the previous oneNo microtransactions, so all content is yours for the taking!",Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 or higherProcessor: Recent Intel i3 or AMD alternativeMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia 750Ti with 2GB or AMD alternativeDirectX: Version 11Storage: 15 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: requires online connection,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 or higherProcessor: Recent Intel i7 or AMD alternativeMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia 1060 or AMD alternativeDirectX: Version 11Storage: 15 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: requires online connection,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,74600,31300,94800,0,0

Players place tiles onto the top-down grid to direct units across the battlefield. Destroy an enemies base to stop reinforcements then finish off their remaining army to claim victory. Tile Battle is easy to jump into but various factions, abilities, and gameplay settings provide more depth to be discovered for returning players.Features2-4 local players. (Tile Battle is local multiplayer only)Choose from 3 factions and 9 different faction abilities.Play across 6 maps per player count for a total of 18 unique maps.Customize game settings to fit your preferred experience.Many controller types supported. One player can use the mouse and keyboard to play.GAMEPLAYUnits and BasesEach player starts the round with bases that automatically spawn units. Units walk in a straight line until they bump into a wall and turn around. Units will automatically engage in combat when they get close enough to attack an enemy. A player wins the game when all enemy units and bases are destroyed.Moving UnitsThe player uses their cursor to place direction tiles (left, right, up, down) onto a grid space. When a unit of any team walks onto a directional tile they will change to walk the direction of the tile. Tiles need to be used both offensively to get your units to the enemy base and defensively to redirect enemies away from your own base. This becomes more challenging because you are limited to 5 active tiles. Players have the ability to remove a tile on a cooldown to sabotage an enemy's plan or to help push through their defenses.FactionsPlayers can choose from one of three factions before the game starts. Choose between Marauders, The Guild, and Haunted. Each faction has its own unique base unit with two additional special units. Play each faction to discover their varying strengths and weaknesses.Abilities Each faction comes with three unique abilities to choose from. Players pick their faction ability before the game starts. Abilities range from the offensive fireball to the buff spell Undying which empowers units and delays their death.Game SettingsCustomize gameplay parameters to fit you and your friend's play style. Change game speed, spawn rates, sudden death settings and much more. Easily save and load presets to quickly get back to your favorite settings.About the developerCreated by LadrikDev: This is my first completed entry into the indie game scene.

In a cute low-poly environment you enjoy crazy battles with 30+ different spells, preferably together with your friends.Focus is placed on both player-skill and teamwork in this matchbased game with quick rounds.There is no story to follow and the aim of the game is to have fun and become a better player to be able to defeat the different game modes in a harder difficulty!And to top the Leaderboards of course!GAMEPLAYGhostly Horizon provides intense and thrilling battles with a focus on player-skill and cooperation.Combat feels dangerous and your winning streak can quickly go down the toilet.​So get ready for some awesome battles and clutch saves in this fun and crazy matchbased game.2 Main Game-Modes: Invasion and Survival  that can be played in both Singleplayer and in Co-op with up to 10 players!3 Minor Game-Modes: Battle Royale, Conquest and Training Arena where you play either Free-For-All or Teambased PvP.SPHERICAL WORLDThe world in Ghostly Horizon is a round (spherical) planet with completely free and open circumnavigation. There are no borders or restrictions for player-movement.The planet features full day/night cycle with one sun and two moons along with a variety of biomes, including: Desert, leaf-woods, pine-woods, arctic, lakes and more.PLAYER SKILLAll players have the same amount of stats, what matters is how you allocate them to suit your playstyle. Depending on your allocation of stats your character gets adjusted traits such as movement speed, jump height, cooldown time, status effect duration, etc.This together with choosing your spell-elements wisely during gameplay to accommodate your own personal playstyle is what gives you the edge in battle.​SPELLSThe vision with spells in Ghostly Horizon is that there shouldn't be two spells that work exactly the same. There are many types of spells: Projectile, Bolt, Spray, Slash, Ray, Instant, Self-targeted. All of these types have a number of spells in them and each one is unique. There are 7 different elements with 4 spells each. A player can have 2 elements active at one time, each element has its own style and which ones the player chooses will alter the playstyle of the player.​There are plans on synergy-spells that will arrive in an expansion after release. The player then gets a unique spell that is a merge between the two elements chosen.COOPERATIONA large part of Ghostly Horizon is cooperation, some game-modes require cooperation to be able to take objectives, others don't enforce it. But nonetheless working together will give your team the upper-hand.​Healing-spells are designed mainly to be used on your friends, your survivability will most likely raise if you work together and heal each other, before it is too late. You can also work together by casting a boost-ray on your friend to make his spells do more damage, or cast a boost-AoE to make all your allies damage more while inside the area of effect. ​Fast travel with teleports that are created by 3 or more players casting boost-rays on each other in a circle to conjure up a teleport. It might be risky though, there is a hidden science behind teleports and you might end up popping out of the enemies teleport if you don't know what you are doing.GRAPHICSGhostly Horizon is presented in a low-poly style with a mix of hard and soft gradients in textures. The aim is a stylized, beautiful and cute looking game that makes the intense gameplay and cut-throat battles come as a surprise.​We aim at an effortless feeling with a flow in both world-design and graphics-design.",Minimum:OS: Windows 7Processor: Intel i5 1.8GHzMemory: 2048 MB RAMGraphics: Intel HD 4000DirectX: Version 9.0cStorage: 400 MB available spaceSound Card: Any Stereo card,Recommended:OS: Windows 10Processor: Intel i7 2.6 GHzMemory: 2048 MB RAMGraphics: RX 470 4gb or GTX 1050 2gbDirectX: Version 9.0cNetwork: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 400 MB available spaceSound Card: Any Stereo card,Minimum:OS: Mac OS X 10.9+Processor: Intel i5 1.8GHzMemory: 2048 MB RAMGraphics: Intel HD 4000Storage: 400 MB available spaceSound Card: Any Stereo card,Recommended:OS: Mac OS X 10.9+Processor: Intel i7 2.6 GHzMemory: 2048 MB RAMGraphics: Radeon Pro 450 2048 MBNetwork: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 400 MB available spaceSound Card: Any Stereo card,Not supported,Not supported,85400,54400,38500,76700,47500

No one knows where a tricky road of adventures can lead…In the world where dangerous adventures are a fact of life, three brothers were born. They lived together until the eldest one (his name is still a mystery) got a message from beyond. One night he secretly left his home. They say he has become a demonologist, but no one can confirm that for sure.Later Zeralt, the middle brother, made his way to the Misty Lands. He actually decided to do that because he lost his beloved one — she perished in the paws of an unknown monstrosity. Locals say that Zeralt wants to make a deal with the dark side to return both of his dearest to life.The youngest brother, Beralt, was into travelling. The most of his «travelling» though was visiting inns and brothels infamous all over Cyvia. This still made him a strong and intelligent warrior, a defender of his lands.One day, fighting the undead, Beralt made a fatal mistake. Vettlaff, a dying beast slain by Beralt’s sword, emitted something… unearthly. It easily disarmed Beralt and charmed him with a mighty dark spell. He could do nothing else but flee, run in terror, run for his life…Escape the Darkness is the first project of the Indie Ninjas company.

646,763270,Fritz Chess 16 Steam Edition,ChessBase GmbH,Strategy,"Apr 3, 2018","When is chess the most enjoyable? When you win! When Fritz entered his first tournaments some 25 years ago, humans still had a real chance of taking the engine down. Only a few years down the line, Fritz was already beating grandmasters left, right and center, but ever since his 4:2 victory over Kramnik in 2006, Fritz has been considered unbeatable. Who would want to play against him? In the case of Fritz 16, however, playing against an engine is now once again the very definition of fun! A host of features, including ""Assisted Analysis"", which gives you discreet visual hints as you move, and emoticons, which show Fritz’s mood, are there to help you. Even with little knowledge of chess, you can enjoy many an exciting game, and more importantly, victory, against Fritz. If things don’t work out, Fritz 16 shows you the combinations you might have missed directly after the game with the handy “Tactical Analysis” function, or you can dive right into ""Easy Play"" calculation training to hone your skills. Fritz doesn’t come up short when it comes to playing strength either: the new multiprocessor engine was developed by star programmer Vas Rajlich (""Rybka"") and is up there with the global elite.No other chess program offers you more, with the online manual alone spanning a whopping 457 pages! But you won’t need it - Fritz 16 is intuitive and easy to use, and whether you want to play against the engine, analyze or enjoy some online blitz, Fritz 16 will open just the functions you need at the click of a mouse.""Easy Play"": Play, Train, Win!It is indeed as simple as it sounds. You now only need one click to start a new game and you can immediately play out any position against Fritz 16. Even more important: earlier versions of Fritz offered various sparring functions (Handicap, Friend, etc.) to emulate “normal” human play. In Fritz 16 all these playing modes are combined in one function: ""Easy Play"". Just choose a level from Beginner – Occasional Player – Club Player – Strong Club Player – Master – Grandmaster and the program acts accordingly. Fritz 16 plays according to the chosen level but intentionally commits hidden errors, tactical errors in particular! So, don’t shy away from lively attacking games! You will definitely crush the program occasionally! Funny: during the game Fritz 16 shows your ELO-performance but also uses FritzEmoticons to show how he feels!But of course Fritz 16 is not always easy to beat. Here a new training function comes into play which you should try if you are not certain about your move: hold the piece you want to move a bit longer with the mouse. This activates the new function ""Assisted Analysis“, and shows you how good each possible move of this piece is. This tactical safety net increases your playing strength! New training methods to calculate: improve core competence!""Calculating variations correctly is the core component of playing strength"", as ChessBase head programmer Matthias Wüllenweber put it with nice distinction. If you play regularly you know how true this is! Fritz 16 offers you the opportunity to test your calculating skills during your games. The focus is on calculating and visualising positions correctly. Fritz helps to check whether the moves are legal and tactically correct which helps to calculate meaningful variations. The highlight: a right click with the mouse always allows you to compare the real and the visualised position.Additional improvements in Fritz 16: optional action sounds in blitz games give advice about mistakes by you or your opponent – kibitzing live-games with asymmetrical multiboard – 3D-multiboard – a program that helps to enter games when the scoresheets are unreadable – New set of pieces in 2D, and much more!",Minimum:OS: Windows 7Processor: Dual CoreMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: Graphic card with 256 MBDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 4 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Windows Media Player 9,Recommended:OS: Windows 10Processor: PC Intel i5 oder AMD Ryzen 3 (Quadcore)Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Graphic card with 512 MBDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 4 GB available spaceSound Card: DirectX compatible sound cardAdditional Notes: Windows Media Player 11,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,98800,42500,92600,0,82800

A nowhere man Kirihara Shiro surprises himself by becoming a probationer in a popular magazine. Is this the rebirth? About This Game This is an independent pixel game with a great story.   Taking the 13th Minstory Game Production Competition organized by rpg.blue forum as an opportunity, the author spent one month creating this rebirth-themed game (to celebrate the nirvana of the forum). Instead of the traditional RM characters, the author designed original 6-frame & 4-body proportion characters for this game and drew the characters in waiting status and all kinds of event status, which is new and refreshing. Story Design The players will play the decadent man Kirihara Shiro who rarely leaves home. He is unsociable and not very talkative. He has been muddling along without any aim. But a streak of light appears in the darkness. The players will set forth from the perspective of Kirihara Shiro and get the game going to explore the hidden secrets.  Game Concept Existence is a very important concept in the game, which directly affects where the game moves forward, and all NPCs’ conversations and responses as well. If the existence is lower than a certain value, Kirihara Shiro’s existence will be weakened. People around will ignore him and he will become visually transparent. When the existence is 0, then the game is over. Game Ending The game has three endings which can not change the game result. Only with the true end, can the player learn about the whole story.

Sorry, multiplayer is too much for this solo developer.More profile related features and abilities are planned to allow players to emulate features from even more FPS games, but the existing options are extremely flexible as is. As the developer, I consider FPS Aim Trainer a tool that I will be using well into the future. My goal is to keep it relevant to gamers as long as I can. Among my top priorities: advanced movement mechanics such as bunnyhopping and strafe jumping, graph/histogram to look at your scores and accuracies over time, bot types of player-recorded paths, and simulated network lag.Running Unreal Engine 4, all graphical options that affect framerate or input lag have been disabled by default. Literally every console command was investigated to see whether any more performance could be eeked out of the engine, because you can never have enough frames per second when you are training for competitive FPSs. As such, the graphics of the game at release will not improve, although things like more options for weapon models and floor/wall textures are planned down the line.","Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 or laterProcessor: Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or fasterMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or higherStorage: 700 MB available space",Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 or laterProcessor: 2nd Generation Intel Core series (Sandy Bridge) or higher.

669,825350,Downhill Deceits,Jack,Action/Adventure/Casual/Indie/Strategy,"Apr 2, 2018","The world has ended.That is enough exposition.Downhill Deceits is a fun game where you play as a quiet man on an orange bike who goes down because an old man told him to, and there are islands. The laws of physics have been altered in convenient ways that allow our hero to fall from sky-island to sky-island on his bike/mobility-scooter/thing that he has from the beginning of the game. No one knows why the man on the orange bike is ascending up the elevator to a modernly-decorated room, and no one will find out. Before any questions can be answered, the man on the orange bike is confronted by the girl. No one knows who the mysterious blind-folded girl on the edge of the terrace is, and no one will find out. Before the man on the orange bike can become a non-silent protagonist, something happens that will change the course of the universe forever.Downhill Deceits features a drastically original game-play system that has never been seen by anyone ever. Maybe. One simple game-play rule: Go down to progress the story. Don't worry, you'll surely find another island to fall safely upon (because there's no fall damage for some reason). There's an arcadey physics-based combat system that allows you to slow down time to shoot a variety of sci-fi cubes at a wide range of enemy types. From the onset, expect weak foes such as the meager ficus, but use your sci-fi currency to upgrade your gear to take on the more aggressive foes that desire to obstruct your goals. There is only one rule to progress the story: Go down!Features:-A quiet man on an orange bike-A girl-An old man who watches your base and motivates you-An Asian guy who shows up every once and a while-Islands littered with amazing detail-Scifi-currency & Upgrade system-An amazing sci-fi cube gun-Ficus-Followers of The Faith of Uckerism-Amazing boss fights -Ability to use custom music*-Harley Mode**-Support for multiple aspect ratios***-Full Japanese dialogue*****To utilize custom music, start the game at least once, then place your choice of three appropriate .wav files into the folders in the folder titled ""DownhillDeceitsMusic"".

For a more easygoing experience, wait for 5-10 seconds on the menu until the ""Harley Mode"" toggle appears in the lower left-hand corner and switch the toggle to ""on"".***While technically any aspect ratio is supported (hacks might be required), some text is only view-able via 16:9 or 16:10, and 4:3 will cut it off. ****The Japanese included might be incorrect or not make any sense. It was included mostly for the sake of practice.After that amazing description, there should be no doubt left in your heart as to whether or not you should get the game. Expect 3-6 hours of game-play from the story, which is more than fair considering the game's almost non-existent price tag.

The only thing he knows for sure is that he saw her as a rival. To defeat her. To humiliate her. To destroy her. For the first 16 years of his life, he drew breaths for those reasons alone. But then… nothing. They eventually went their separate ways, as change is the inevitability that comes with those younger years.

Online games provide colour and dynamism for my life. Therefore I want to stand by this game of mine, which I nurtured since development phase. I can’t overlook the fact that my game stories, inspections and guides led the way during the times I raised awareness. I have to make additions to story part of things.Hello there! This is my first game, and I feel honour and pride to share it with my fellow gamers. Unseen Anchor has an endless and repeatable playability, which is full of love. I’ll be waiting for all your feedback on Facebook (@Bur6kBahar) and on Steam forums.Before I forget… I want to thank all my friends, who pioneered and/or supported growth and development of Steam Turkey.Thank you all for your friendship and solidarity.Burak,Invasion EraAbout the GameUnlimited ammo and only five energy boosts. Unseen Anchor writes the foreword for an impossible war of endless playability cycle through modern designs accompanied by wave and score system. Infinite planet under Viktor Crysworth’s command is after the space ship named Space Submarine, which is harbouring last surviving humans. Your purpose is to destroy as many planets as possible.Unseen Anchor consists of an endless cycle game, and a story mode with 30+ text boxes. Players need to advance through the game by destroying 4 types of planets in the game with 1 spaceship available to them.You can access basic properties of destructible planets via text boxes in origin story.You can pause the game with “P” key to avoid any problems during high score attempts.You can quickly restart the game with “R” key during warm-up sessions.For a better gameplay experience and protecting aspect ratio, you can switch to windowed screen with Numpad “-“ key, and return to full-screen mode with “+” key.I, an apprentice “Spectre”, was well aware of the fact that war has always been the dominant force ruling the terra firma for the ancient army. It has been four years since the head spectre left us; we had four long years of gaming with even time itself left orphaned… Our war against the awful truth became more and more unbearable day by day. Even the pipes of fruitfulness we used to have a breather away from war were malfunctioning, so I couldn’t take it any longer. Making the most of my body parts still in function, I screamed until I couldn’t. My screaming gave pain to mortal men and power to spectres, and thus given me back all the escape steps taken by National Security Agency (aka NSA). I now control all armies, they completely obey me... Even though this is hell for another world, you have adopted futuristic apparel of creatures from outside. I am the Unstoppable, the Untouchable, the Unbeatable and the Unlimited Dark Engineer, Viktor Crysworth.I can’t keep my silence any longer… I was created to fill the tactical gap left behind by the late ultimate leader. I established  Fifth Echelon and trained the best agents of all time. During the operations on my memory, I saw how deep and powerful death can be. Scars full of mistakes and longing, which I can’t find an ointment for, have left their places to life-giving operations. Now my only leverage is elevated and deadly tactical assault algorithms, empowered with my pen.During the time my algorithms were implemented by god, truth has decided who were the puny ones, and started to wait for a suitable time to settle their accounts. After that, I showed all the spectres that mortals are not worthy opponents. A divine rebirth occurred, and “Echelon” dynasty reclaimed the its well-deserved place. Since that day we haven’t slept for a second. Puny ones were decided, and I showed the spectres that mortals are not worthy opponents. We created reds to illuminate our fog of war, and we marched onwards.The earth is no more. Spectre army will lead the way to create space lands, and these lands will breathe for The Dark Engineer for the rest of time. That flawed ship will not be enough to save you. You won’t be able to save your nation, nor secure your future.Do not forget, death won’t sleep for spectres, either.

If the intel is found within the time limit, the spy seeking it wins the game. If not, the spy who originally hid the intel wins!

723,640850,Clash of Cards,Azorian/kron0s_alexey/Pavel_Balakin,Nudity/Violent/Indie/Strategy/Early Access,"Mar 31, 2018","This is a smart, honest and deep hardcore game. A true intellectual challenge. I just got tired of cartoon casual card battlers, pay-to-win games, random focused game mechanics, timers, energy bars, speed-ups and other free-to-play crap. Together with my friend, various CG artists and game enthusiasts from all over the world we’ve made a game free of this annoying stuff. Play how you want and as much as you want.It’s originalRips of MTG and Hearthstone made by studios with huge marketing budgets have filled the market. Piece of cake: popular franchise + successful mechanics + $ = $$$. We’ve made an original title. We realize that it's a huge risk. I’m sure the question: “Damn, what’s just happened?” - will be a pretty popular thought. Skillful in another game? Forget your experience. It's not a rip. Mechanics are original but very logical. Don’t hurry. Read, examine, experiment. Enjoy discovering the layers of the game. We have almost forgotten this feeling.It’s honest. No pay-to-winThere are no paid advantages in PvP. Don’t wait for compromises or casual stuff. PvP is extremely intense. One mistake may cost you the victory. You can win or lose in a minute. Everything depends on your strategy. It’s a true fight of intellects. After the first 20 battles you will respect that guy on the top with 3000+ wins. I don’t know how he’s made it. Especially with the cards he had.The AI is uniqueThere is a lot of PvE content in the game. Feeling so powerful after victory in Elven Fist mission? Try challenges, limited time events, side quests and daily quests. You always have a possibility to grow. The AI is brilliant. He does not know your cards, so no cheating. He used to be so good that we had to make him dumber because he ruined the server. Still don’t wait for favors from him. He’s not as creative as you but he knows how all the cards work. Wanna a core fight? Only 20% can finish the story.It’s finely balancedNo strongest race, strongest card or warlord. The balance is perfect. There are no imba decks. You can suddenly lose from a weak bot. Though I hate random there is a luck factor in the game. Why? Because it’s a great balancing tool. It gives a chance to win like in real life. But fortune favors the prepared. Choose from the 300+ card pool, 18 warlords (with 3 skills each) and get ready for any surprise.It’s really variableRace tactics are different. Warlords are different. Some of the cards are pretty complicated. Use them as a scalpel not as a hammer. Gonna play as an assassin? Don’t pick up the dwarves, they are heavy, slow and prefer fortification. Your choice is the elves. Like meaty heavy rush? Don’t pick up the undead. They are controllers, have powerful spells. But ghosts and skeletons do not have a lot of health and it’s logical. Your choice is the orcs. Or mix them with other cards. A deadly stab in the opponent’s back by an elven assassin is a good start for the orcish rush. Now it’s role playing through strategy. You are your army. To me, role playing is not about spreading experience points or choosing who to sleep with virtually. It is your own unique battle style. The game gives you enough content for that. You can play as a mage or a warrior, an assassin or a tank, a necromancer or a paladin and more. To improve social interaction we’re already working on a huge update with clans, a global map with POI and a non-linear campaign. We need your support, guys, to make the game live on Steam. So what is Clash of Cards about? It’s about how intelligence wins. How intelligence gives us a chance to win the hardest battles.Who asked for a hardcore and honest old-school collectible card game?Here it is.

<br />
您也许正在经历或者已经经历过中国式家长的洗礼。中国式家长有很多通病，但他们是爱你的，也许爱的方式不对。<br />
那些曾经对你的期望，在现在这个飞速发展、阶级固化的时代，要经过几代人的努力才能完成呢？<br />
这款游戏，能够让您回忆起那些与父母的点点滴滴，那些或烦恼或忧愁，又或者是那些童年的小确幸。<br />
<br />
游戏将会模拟从玩家出生到高考结束，这段和父母朝夕相处的时间。通过以下主要系统，展现中国式家长的一些特点。<br />
<br />
【挖脑洞】玩家可以通过点击脑洞格子获得基础属性和悟性，属性越高，则学习技能所需的悟性越少。是为了面子和培养孩子早期的自信，选择揠苗助长学习更多技能？还是厚积薄发，培养好属性能力，后面的技能水到渠成？<br />
<br />
【日程安排】玩家需要平衡好学习和娱乐两项，前者会提高父母满意度和自身压力，后者相反。若平衡不好，会遭到父母的责罚，自身压力过大会出现心理问题，对属性有削减作用。同时，安排完日程后，也会遇到很多特殊事件，回味与父母的点点滴滴，以及这些小事带来的影响。<br />
<br />
【面子对战】玩家的父母，在社会中会遭遇各色人群，如讨厌的亲戚、熊孩子、多年不见的闺蜜、塑料姐妹花等角色。对于这些人的炫耀攻击，父母会拿孩子在技能学习中获得的特长，进行反击。看谁最后更有面子！如果给父母丢了面子，结果。。。大家应该都经历过。<br />
<br />
【中国有特长选秀】浮躁的社会中，一切特长都会被拿来当做猎奇信息来消费，玩家可以拿自己最厉害的特长进行选秀，如果获得大奖可获得非常多的面子值。<br />
<br />
【阶层追求】本游戏是以代际更迭为基础，这一代孩子结束达成职业结局后，会作为下一代的父亲，玩家可继续进行下一代游戏。上一代的职业、性格、配偶，会影响到下一代的基础属性、零用钱等等。本游戏目前已有70余种职业结局，若干种婚姻结局，玩家初始为普通职业家庭出身（普通家庭不是马爸爸那种普通家庭），玩家不知道要经过多少代才能达成父母期望，实现阶层跨越呢？或者只是想遵从自己的天赋和内心，选择自己喜欢的职业，需要什么样的家庭基础呢？这些都是玩家可以在游戏中体验并深深感受到的，也可以体会父母作为“过来人”的良苦用心。","Minimum:OS: XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10Processor: Intel Pentium III 800 MHz+Memory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: 1024x768 High Color +DirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 500 MB available space",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,16500,58400,19100,0,53100

In addition, many artists around the world have contributed to Soul Saga to help give it the well rounded and polished art such a game deserves.  With over an hour of original music tailored specifically for JRPG fans, Soul Saga is both a fun and artistic journey through a familiar, yet fresh, world.StoryOterra was a once lush and vibrant world, but it’s surface is now wasted after the events of an ancient cataclysm.  The planet is now split into 3 distinguishable layers: the Sky Islands of Medonia, the Tempest Reef, and the Surface World of Oterra.This cataclysm was caused by a mysterious corruption called Ink that mutated the world’s creatures into monsters called Inkheart.  The Inkheart ravaged society and mercilessly destroyed civilizations as they spread across Oterra.  The last haven for humanity, Medonia, was saved by a mysterious man called the Philosopher.  The Philosopher introduced the science of Alchemy to Medonia’s people and they took up arms using their new Alchemical powers, but it was too late.  The Dragons of Oterra had succumbed to the Ink corruption and joined the assault against Medonia.  As a last effort, the Philosopher used his powers to raise Medonia off of the planet and into the sky, setting it safely on the clouds above and out of the reach of the indomitable Inkheart.And now... 300 years after it’s conception, the Tempest Reef is weakening, the Islands of Medonia are dying and falling from the sky, and an omen of catastrophic proportions has appeared.  There are rumors of a passage called Cloud’s End that will allow a ship passage through the Tempest Reef to the surface world below.  It's assumed that one man found this passage, but left no trace of its existence behind.  The Guilds of Medonia now search for Cloud’s End in hope to find a cure for their dying islands somewhere on the surface of Oterra.Armed with alchemy and a mysterious sword, an ambitious young Guild Master travels the sky islands of Medonia in his new airship to uncover a way to save his homeland, but is he ready for the truth?Help Mithos and Elise fight against the impending menace threatening the sky islands of Medonia with their guild of close friends and unlikely allies.

The new budget allowed Soul Saga to enhance its art style and gameplay based on fan feedback, but was still too small to finance a large dev team.  I then dedicated the next 3 years of my life working on Soul Saga as the only full time developer to bring you the best game I could.

You are in direct control of your ship. Star Sonata is a 3D top down action based game. Other games, you just press a dodge key, but in Star Sonata you have to manually pilot your ship and avoid those laser beams, bullets, and missiles! Using real time strategy (RTS) controls you can also create robot controlled ships to fight alongside you and deploy defensive or offensive drone platforms. Build your Empire in a Sandbox style universe — Manage your colonies, build bases, deploy defensive drones, establish trade routes with robot controlled ships. The universe resets every 3-4 months which randomizes the galaxies in player buildable space, creating new conflict where there were once settled borders. Players can advance economically by trading between bases, creating their own bases and colonies, killing enemies, collecting Player versus Player (PVP) bounties, or completing one of the 2000 missions. There are thousands of different items that can be obtained or constructed and sold to other players. Become Emperor of the Universe — A player can “win” the game by declaring themselves emperor and defending their palace successfully until the end of the universe. Don’t like the Emperor or want to be the Emperor yourself? Star Sonata is a player vs player game with the universe separated into distinct PVP and non-PVP zones; fight your enemies and lead your team to glory. You can partake in large scale PVP conflicts with hundreds of players, or even little skirmishes on fringe systems. No two players are alike — Star Sonata includes a wide variety of skills and customization options including eight classes, four trade skills, 127 total skills that give various stat increases that the players can train, over 250 player obtainable ships, the ability to change nearly every aspect of your ship’s build including the engine, weapons, energy, shield, and more!

Imagine becoming your favorite movie character by taking their place as the main star. Embodying Darth Vader and “altering the deal”, or stepping into Jack Sparrow’s boots and drunkenly slurring “where’s the rum?!” Innovative entertainment means taking mediums we know and love and taking a new perspective.<br />
<br />
Another main inspiration was Ernest Cline’s “Ready Player One”. In the story, when an OASIS avatar begins a FlickSync game, they become a specific character from a movie and have to recite lines of dialogue. When the avatar speaks, they will speak in the voice of the specific character, move around as the character, see, hear, and feel anything the character would see, hear, and feel in the movie.<br />
<br />
Players can take on the roles of their favorite story characters, acting out scenes and speaking the lines of their assigned character. They enter into the Tea Party scene from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and become Alice, the Mad Hatter, or the March Hare. They can also play the scenes with their friends, with each person being assigned different characters using their own Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Windows MR headsets. During the scenes, when a character needs to speak, a cue card shows the user the lines assigned to them. They have to speak the lines correctly within an assigned period of time. Players are scored by how well they speak their lines of dialogue.

This allows you to change strategies on the fly by instantly sending your ship’s power reserves to whatever system you need most. You can use speed to outmaneuver your enemies, power up your shields to survive the most dangerous assaults, or overload your weapons to rain destruction on your foes.StoryThe year is 2563, and humanity is locked in a civil war. Desperately looking to break the stalemate the TDF has developed an advanced prototype ship with unique capabilities: the Orion.  You, the Orion's pilot, are part of the first TDF battlegroup to encounter a new and hostile alien race; the Arckin.  With both human factions weakened by decades of war a desperate struggle begins against the Arckin, who appear unstoppable and merciless in their destruction of every human ship and colony they encounter.CustomizationThe Orion was designed around a new philosophy in starfighter engineering; the idea that he who most easily adapts is victorious, and adaptability is achieved through modularity.  Nearly every system on the Orion can be easily swapped out for a different or upgraded version with almost zero downtime. With development of the Orion still in full swing those upgrades are becoming available at a steady pace.","Minimum:OS: Windows® 7, 64-bitProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo E4700 2.6 GHz or AMD Phenom 9950 Quad Core 2.6 GHzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: 1GB ATI Radeon HD 5770, 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or betterDirectX: Version 11Storage: 15 GB available space","Recommended:OS: Windows® 7, 64-bitProcessor: 3GHz Quad CoreMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: 2GB ATI Radeon HD 7970, 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 or betterDirectX: Version 11Storage: 15 GB available space",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,56300,0,0,0,0

Please expect Brave Hand to be a small, replayable, solitaire-like card game where your goal is to beat your previous score, and unlock a light story along the way.

In this game we have the usual object grab/throw mechanics, and climbing/falling, but also we explore new technologies in effort to evolve the VR artform:►► Fluid physics that you can push around with your hands, and displaces around your body as you move through it.►► Volumetric Lighting & Fog rendering (realistic smoke with real volume and density)Don't forget to check your system requirements - this game requires a VR-ready system.Support/Contact:  PurgatoryFell@gmail.comFeel free to get in touch with me!

After a night of drinking, you are left on your own. After waking up, you feel really bored and have to be creative to kill time. The purpose is to give you a simple idea and transmit the feeling in the virtual reality zone as if you would be leaving that moment in your life, when you go back to the good old times of being a student (or you are currently a student, whichever hits closer to home).The night before your friends and classmates came over and had a great night. The next day you woke up and were bored. You did not find your place so you started rearranging the messed up house - or you made the choice to mess it up even more. The games goal is not to entertain you, but to make you find entertainment for yourself in your free will by finding stuff to do, which can be challenging as it is. The developers of the game focused on virtual reality features, especially on the movement control to make it as easy as possible at the given time.Even if you can`t actually feel the hangover and the numbness, the developers made it so these feelings are to be met in the pictures on the wall, the lighting and the surroundings, to totally immerse you in that after day sensation.The game has no ending. It ends if however and whenever you want it to do so, which for some makes it even more interesting.In the game you have multiple objects to entertain you.

I was 16 when I started making An Aspie Life and as of now, I’m 17 years old and about to start University. Everyone with autism is a little different. I did not create the game to be offensive in anyway, only trying to explain what it is like to live with, from my point of view.  (WARNING: This game has imagery that potentially can trigger seizures for players with photosensitive epilepsy)About One day your roommate Leaves for no reason. You’re left to face the outside world alone, but this can be both difficult and amazing when you have autism. Just because you have it, doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy life. Some things can be harder to do, but you can do some incredible things as well.  It just makes even the mundane parts of life, an experience. ""An Aspie Life"" is an experimental adventure game that deals with the topic of Asperger's Syndrome. The game is centred around having to live with autism. The players actions in the game will have to adapt to how an autistic person sees the world. As every element of this game recreates how some people with autism perceive the world, therefore all forms of sound, graphics and interactions are intentional.""Video games can be entertaining and educational. When these two qualities are combined, the player not only enjoys being informed, they are also more likely to remember the key themes of the game. ‘An Aspie Life’ is a video game that explores autism through the life experiences of the central character and playing a video game can be more enjoyable and informative than reading literature and watching documentaries"" - Tony Attwood How it represents parts of Asperger's Syndrome. There’s a lot going on in An Aspie life that is meant to make players feel like they are on the spectrum. It’s a little easier in a list:All character in An Aspie Life are black outlines. By doing this, players can’t read body language. Just like someone with autism.  Some characters that the main character knows well, are not black outlines and have some detail. But they are still darkened. This represents how some with autism can learn someone’s body language if they have known them for a long time. In the game, every environmental sound gets represented on the sound sensitivity meter. The player must keep this under control, so the main character does not become overwhelmed. This represents Sound sensitivity in autism. In conversations, the player again can’t read body language, as they are all black outlines.  But they must try and figure out how to respond with limited vocabulary. This represents the difficulty Aspies have in putting thoughts into sentences that people can understand. Also in conversations, the player’s feeling meters of stress, happiness, courage and uneasiness will affect how a conversation plays out. For example, not much courage means you can’t look at the other person. To regenerate the feeling meter, players must go into quiet places or do things that the main character enjoys. That being, playing video games. The game’s art style of blue and purple, represent not just the 80/90s feel of the game but also social isolation. Some items in the game that hold great importance to the main character are not in blue/purple but are in full colour, because of how important they are.",Minimum:OS: Windows VistaProcessor: Intel pentiumMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Intel integrated graphicsDirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 1 GB available spaceSound Card: Integrated,Recommended:OS: Windows 7Processor: Intel i5Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Intel integrated graphicsDirectX: Version 10Storage: 1 GB available spaceSound Card: Integrated,Minimum:OS: 10.9Processor: Intel i5Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Intel integrated graphicsStorage: 1 GB available spaceSound Card: Integrated,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,88000,94800,81600,0,86400

Explore worlds laid with ruins and enemy camps; as you discover, research, and fight to improve and protect your people as you grow.Spiritlands is a game about progression, automation and survival. The goal is to take over the map, founding new settlements, destroying barbarian camps, exploring every ruin and befriending or fighting against the local colonies.Every settlement is designed to be as unique as you want it to be. You can have settlements dedicated to gathering faith points, or settlements geared around collecting a specific resource and distributing to your other towns and cities. You can found multiple cities, or layer your world with villages.Your lands are yours to build up as you please.Your people need 5 things:- Water- Power- Happiness- Food- ShelterYour people are your explorers, workers and soldiers- they fuel your growth and are specific to the settlement they are in.You can build them schools, taverns, create more nature or lay more flooring. Your people love to live in pleasant looking areas to call home! All power and water is natural too- with wind-farms and water-towers. Building is also super quick with the easy to use on-tile system.The people are also vulnerable to fires and infections which require emergency services and health centres to be created to combat them.Resources are the cornerstone for each settlement that you control. They fuel buildings and your people, from feeding them to training them to keeping the machines running. You can utilise your idle workers as resource collectors in the wilds. Soon after your resource collection becomes automated as you create farms, lumberyards, quarries, mines, and fishing areas and assign your people to work them.There are four main resources:- Food- Wood- Stone- CoalThere are also special items such as diamonds, silver, and even flower to collect! They are used to trade, build, or buy off barbarians.Spiritlands definitely isn't a game about staying in one area with one settlement. You're encouraged to explore; placing campfires to break through the fog, uncovering old ruins that to explore for loot chests (not loot boxes). You can also uncover colonies that you can trade or fight with.There are also enemy encampments of different sizes, who will attack your settlements. You can also attack them and try and destroy them first, or give them some special items to keep them happy.There are 4 colonies across each land:- The Port Keepers- The Woodlanders- The Stonecutters- The Miners.Each colony can be traded with at your markets. Once discovered you can befriend them by trading with them the resources that they need, so that they can build and eventually provide you with freebies! Or anger them through attacks and they will raid you for food.Whether you are fighting encampments or waging wars on colonies- combat is a likely part of expanding. By building attack barracks, you can create an army. Whenever barbarians are nearby you will frequently come under attack, so you need to fortify settlements with defence barracks, water towers and walls. Even nature such as mountains make for great defences.There are 30 upgrades that fall into 5 routes: Discoverer, Scientist, Evolutionist, Dictator, and Conqueror.Upgrades range from unlocking buildings to altering resource costs. Everything can be unlocked.The Map Editor is the first thing you see after entering your name and the name of your civilisation. On the screen are 3 different sized paintbrushes, as well as a tile selection panel so you can paint tiles. You can also adjust sliders to adjust the resource amounts in your land- as well as paste in seeds you might get from the forum for example.The Editor is really easy to use, allowing you to create beautiful hand-made landscapes. The default areas are perfectly usable and randomly generated for a little variance. You can also quickly select presets on the side such as Wasteland and Desert which change the difficulty as resources become harder to find.Check out the second video at the top to see!","Minimum:OS: Windows 7+Processor: 1.7 GHz Dual CoreMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, ATI Radeon 4870 HD, or equivalent cardDirectX: Version 10Storage: 400 MB available spaceSound Card: DirectX Compatible Sound Card",Not supported,"Minimum:OS: Version 10.8: ""Mountain Lion"" or laterProcessor: Intel Core DuoMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: ATI Radeon HD 4850, NVIDIA GeForce GT 120, or equivalent card with at least 512 MB VRAMStorage: 400 MB available spaceAdditional Notes: May also work with versions under 10.8.",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,19200,56100,99800,0,0

We’re not looking to create another rendition of Shadow Over Innsmouth, Color Out of Time, At The Mountains of Madness or the typical style established by Call of Cthulhu franchise. We want to create our own style built on the love for the non-traditional adventure gameplay designs of the 90s mixed with aesthetics INSPIRED by Stanley Kubrick (Visual and Sound Design) and HP Lovecraft’s sanity shattering mythos and storytelling style. We want to contrast the darkness with color, light and hope to properly expose players to a true sense of virtual insanity instead of the generic endless darkness, monsters, museum tour walking/exposition simulation and monotone atmosphere that “Lovecraftian” and Haunted House games typically offer. <br />

812,548450,Foreveracers,SuperSmashingGreat Games,Action/Casual/Indie/Racing/Sports,"Mar 29, 2018","Foreveracers is an arcade multiplayer driving game, with a focus on removing a lot of the faff and waiting around often associated with online racing games. Just join a game when you're ready, and start driving.Each car in the game has a distinct feel and unique characteristics, and the physics model means that balance is as much part of challenge (and fun) as the optimal racing line. These cars can wobble and be a handful to control (especially if you're playing on keyboard). Also each car has their own 'optimal racing line', since as long as you hit the checkpoints in order, you're free to find your own route around the circuit!You can challenge (and be challenged by) other players in the game to races or to special challenge modes. Everyone that accepts the challenge will join that game mode, and anyone that doesn't can just carry on driving as they were, maybe to join or issue the next challenge.When not in a challenge, just drive through a start line to begin a lap, drive somewhere else to find another circuit whenever you want, or maybe explore to see if you can find an unlock for the hidden circuits. Or if you just want to quickly change car or jump to a different circuit, you can do so too.Features All one world - You're free to drive between the different circuits, and explore the world, without any reloading. Day/Night cycle - The racing in Foreveracers never ends, so keep driving night and day. Over 12 circuits - 4 initial circuits, 4 hidden circuits to find, and additional mirrored variants to then unlock. Race challenge - Issue a race challenge to other players, those that accept will line up and race to the finish line. Special Challenge Modes - If you want  a break from the racing, then challenge players to a Scavenge Hunt or Rust-Bucket Survival challenge 6 Main Vehicles - from the slow and steady Starter Car, through to the 'too fast' Sports Car, and the frankly ridiculous Clown Car. Leaderboards - See how your lap times compare to others Live world rank - Your current world rank is displayed for whichever circuit you currently have active, try to improve your best time and move up to #1! Ghosts - If you're just lapping alone then the 'ghost' of your best lap will start when you do.Note For Solo PlayersWe believe there is fun to be had with this game even if playing alone - start an online game and while waiting for others to join, you can drive, explore, time trial, try to improve your world ranking and unlock the extra circuits. However, we do want to make it clear that there is no single player 'story' or challenge structure, there are no AI racers in the game, so if you're only looking for a game to play alone/offline, then this may not be for you.Future DevelopmentWe have a number of ideas and plans to how we could further expand the game in future, and we intend for those additions to be free updates. However, we are just a 2 person team working in our spare time around our day jobs, so our focus initially has been to try to make a small, fun game and offer it for what we hope is a fair price. Post release our priority will be to support any issues with the game to make sure it works as we intended.  After that, we will review the feedback from the community to help decide which areas to work on first, so be sure to join the discussions to have your say!",Minimum:OS: Windows 7Processor: Intel Core i3Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD 4000DirectX: Version 11Storage: 1 GB available space,Recommended:OS: Windows 10 64 bitProcessor: Intel Core i5Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: SM 5.0 1GB VRAMDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 1 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: 64-BIT VERSION RECOMMENDED,Minimum:OS: macOS Sierra (10.12)Processor: Intel Core i5Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: SM 5.0 1GB VRAMStorage: 1 GB available space,Recommended:OS: macOS Sierra (10.12)Processor: Intel Core i5Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: SM 5.0 1GB VRAMNetwork: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 1 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: 64-BIT VERSION RECOMMENDED,Minimum:OS: Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTSProcessor: Intel Core i5Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: SM 5.0 1GB VRAMStorage: 1 GB available space,Recommended:OS: Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTSProcessor: Intel Core i5Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: SM 5.0 1GB VRAMNetwork: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 1 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: 64-BIT VERSION RECOMMENDED,26400,78700,66400,38000,49200

Ancient warrior machines spawn from Golem Gates while an unseen force compels you to take up arms. Wielding the power hidden within ‘The Ash’, you’ll battle the golems and unravel the mysteries surrounding their long-lost creators.Golem Gates blends elements of real-time strategy (RTS) and card battle. Collect cards (called Glyphs) containing your forces and powers. Strategically weave them into a deck to prepare for battle, then create them on the field to defeat your enemies in fast-paced and highly tactical battles with streamlined management to keep focus on the action. Play singleplayer or multiplayer in local matches with bots, online matches with other players, single and co-op Survival, solo challenge scenarios and a full single player campaign.Dynamic Diversity: 100 Glyphs provide the options for your strategy: Units, buildings, traps, buffs, debuffs, and techs. Create your own unique battle plan and counter your opponents'. Randomized drawing puts a slightly different spin on every battle - eliminating monotonous build sequences, rewarding deckbuilding skill and strategic planning in equal measure.Streamlined Strategy: Build your forces and enhance them with Glyphs; no production or research buildings needed. Capture resources in King of the Hill style without dedicated gathering units. Keep your focus where it belongs: on the battle.Fight Where You Have Sight: Glyphs can be played almost anywhere you have an existing presence. Add more forces to a battle to turn the tide, transform a scouting party into an army, place emergency defenses to respond to the enemy, or hide an outpost in a direction the enemy doesn't expect. The choices are yours, but beware: the enemy will do the same and with the right Glyph your forces can be destroyed as fast as they were created.",Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7/8.1/10 64-bitProcessor: Intel Core i3 2.4 Ghz/AMD Phenom II 2.5 GhzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GTX 480 / AMD Radeon HD 5870DirectX: Version 10Storage: 15 GB available space,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7/8.1/10 64-bitProcessor: Intel Core i5 2.8 Ghz/AMD FX-8320Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 / AMD Radeon R9 280XDirectX: Version 11Storage: 15 GB available space,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,93500,96000,70500,28300,0

<br />
It's not about blowing things up or flying spaceships, it's about disabling circuits by using their weaknesses against them.  The key is to strategically take down each circuit while scoring as many points as you can on each and every one.  Clever tricks and timing lead to monumental scores.  It's up to you to discover how to do it!<br />
<br />
Each PCB is controlled by batteries and a microswitch and protected by electrons.  Transfer power between batteries to overload the circuit and take control, but watch the microswitch -- if it ticks across to closed the PCB will shut down.  Avoid the red electrons as they will deplete the batteries with each hit.   Once you've overloaded the circuit you are in control and it's your chance to turn the tables on the electrons.  Collect as many as you can while avoiding the Debugger which searches the PCB for you to end your overtime early.<br />

Games have time limit, which is the length of the song. You can compare your score from each mini-game with other players. The game will also attract you by its overall atmosphere.The first mini-game – ""Concubine"" will lead you to the stage of initial being in love. Try to run away anywhere, it will get you; but you can give it a try. Jump to avoid arrows She is shooting at you. Getting the hang of double-jump technique will test your skills. You gain one point for each successfully avoided arrow, and if you touch the arrow, you lose a point.In the second mini-game ""As a last-day we live"" you will try to find features He and She have in common. The game is an original form of Pairs. There are two stocks of cards, in which the first one represents features of He and the second one those of She. You draw from the left stock and try to find its match in the right one. The matching pictures aren’t the same, but they relate to one another. The help in the upper part of the screen gradually shows the correct pairs. Each pair found wins the player 10 points. Each mismatched pair loses one point.In the third mini-game ""Expiration date"" you will move to the stage in which the element of love is fading away and you get to the phase of fierce fights. As time goes by, you cease to understand each other and sometimes it happens that UFOs, or unidentified flying objects, start to fly upon you. In this game, those will be identified objects, namely plates. Touching a plate you break it and win a point for each one. If a plate hits you, you lose a point.

883,688140,Tempest 4000,Llamasoft Ltd.,Casual,Spring 2018,"Tempest 4000™ is a visually stunning, action-packed tube shooter based on the classic hit arcade game, Tempest™.  Developed by legendary game designer, Jeff Minter, Tempest 4000™ remains faithful to the original fast-paced gameplay by putting you in control of the Claw, a powerful spacecraft equipped to destroy deadly creatures and other obstructions with rapid-fire shots on vibrant geometric prisms.  Featuring fantastical graphical environments, 100 levels, three game modes, and more, you must eliminate all enemies as fast as possible to survive and compete for the highest score on the leaderboards.Tempest 4000 is already looking as dazzling as its counterpart, and while it does follow the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” sort of logic, it’s still a delight to play, with plenty of goofy quotes and flashy presentation to go around. It’s just the kind of old-school bliss that’ll come in handy for breaks between other AAA titles. – ComicbookTempest 4000 is a great iteration on an arcade classic - ZamThe new game, which releases later this year, brings the neon lights, geometric graphics  and pulse-pounding soundtrack that is a series trademark, alongside the addictive, frantic gameplay that has kept Tempest a popular franchise for over three decades. – DestructoidTempest is back and it's every bit as frantic as it was before. – TrueAchievementsTempest 4000 is a collaborative love-letter for Tempest fans from Minter and Atari that’s been enhanced for contemporary audiences with exciting new features and gorgeous 4K graphics. – COGconnected","Minimum:OS: Windows 7 SP1 64bit, Windows 8.1 64bit, Windows 10 64bitProcessor: Intel Core i3-2120 CPU 3.30GhzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 4600 or higherDirectX: Version 10Storage: 2 GB available spaceSound Card: Windows Compatible Sound card",Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,49200,33000,59000,0,52600
884,713310,Gambol,Mike Pickering,Action/Indie,"Mar 27, 2018","      Gambol is a wall-hopping, ceiling-slapping jaunt of a platformer with straight forward controls, and buttery smooth movement.  You control the Gambol Gumball through a gauntlet of levels designed with flow and rhythm in mind to test your platforming grit.  But don't be too nervous, because along with the slick controls you also have a triple jump that's energy is reset upon touching any (non-lethal) surface, including the ceiling.  Holy cow, that sounds great.  The controls are simple enough that you could play it on a NES controller, with only run, jump, left, right, down-boost, and [REDACTED] to worry about. What's that “[REDACTED]” all about?  Hah, don't think too much about it, it's probably nothing.      “Whoa!” you say, “this looks crazy hard, is this one of those games that Poo-Dee-Pah yells at on the YouVideo?”  Nah, it's not too bad, the levels appear a bit tougher than they really are since I had to put in more obstacles to make up for all that sweet, juicy, player agency you have. Oh, and when you inevitably meet your demise at the hands of a spike, laser, bomb, floating-shock-ball-of-hurt, or whatever else, you re-spawn within a couple seconds (or just hit the level-restart button if you're fidgety like me), so it's no biggie if you have to re-run a level a few times before you get the hang of it.  But for all you hardcore platforming buffs out there, I've made a second, harder difficulty with special levels, and normal mode levels with more hazards added.  Oh my!      Inconsequential!  It's probably about candy or jellybeans or some such nonsense.  Honestly, the story is just a vehicle to move the action along, so it's not super important, but I'll work something in there, just you see, and chapter four will shock you!super-smooth Modern Platforming Action!A triple jump that's energy is reset upon collision with any non-lethal surface.  Wowie!130+  Levels, designed to flow in a way so that they can be (fairly) easily speedran once mastered NO AUTOSCROLLERS! !Wild hazards to avoid!, and one to use to your advantage if you're gutsy enough to experiment (hint: not the spikes, those just kill you.  Don't try using those for anything.  Except to die.  Which you will do if you touch them.  Avoid at all costs).No weird gravity mechanics, or things to make you motion sick.  Back in my day we liked our colors bright and our gravity linear (only going down, baby!)Simple, customizable controls that anyone can master.  Cool beans!Two difficulties: One for normies like myself, and one for people who, I don't know, like losing?  It's super hard, but whatever! Yay!Q: What Platforms Will the Game Run On?A:  Windows/PC.  It is possible (though not promised) that Linux and Mac versions may come in the future, though they will certainly not be available at launch.Q: How Many People Are Working On This Game?A: Just this guy!, Mike.  Catch me on the Tweeterverse @ACEJester <3  Oh, and Andrew Lippens is the composer.  He's super cool, too.Q:  What Inspired Gambol?A:  I love games with wall-jumping, but I haven't found one with the mechanic done how I'd like it done, so I've made my own!","Minimum:OS: Microsoft Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10Processor: 2.4 GHz or fasterMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: Integrated graphics made within last 4 years, or just about any dedicated graphics card within last 10.Storage: 400 MB available space",Not supported,Minimum:OS: 10.7 or newerProcessor: Intel based Macs only.Memory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: Any 2012 or newer Mac should work easily.Storage: 400 MB available space,Not supported,"Minimum:OS: Any version that can run Steam Client.Processor: 2.4 GHz or fasterMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: Integrated graphics made within last 4 years, or just about any dedicated graphics card within last 10.",Not supported,18100,20500,0,91700,0

<br />
The necklace of blood is a jewel which many would give their lives for,  they don’t imagine the power and responsibility of owning it. The necklace has been cursed and bathed in the blood of Satan himself, the necklace was consecrated on the altars of death to cause the madness of men.<br />
<br />
The evil one has sent a powerful Jackal to this dimension, his son, to be confused among men.<br />

The mission of the Jackal is to enforce a prophecy written more than 200 years ago, which points to the moral and religious destruction of a great metropolis, New York.<br />
<br />
To fulfill the objective, the Jackal recruits men, in different ways, and turns them into vassals at the service of darkness, to spread the plague.<br />

Upon returning to school, the students quickly discover that they are the only living people around.

It's CCG meets action RPG, combining card collecting and deck building with frantic combat. Choose your heroes, build your deck, and save Vitrerran.A Real-Time Card GameThe Land of Glass is a new kind of card game, one where combat doesn't go back and forth in precise turns but operates in real time. The strategy and synergy of typical CCGs is present; however, you'll need more than that to succeed. The monsters won't wait for you to choose your best cards.Combat takes place over two ever-changing grids: attack and defense. Punish your foes with big, heavy blows or swift strikes while countering with a steady stream of defense cards. Use magic to infuse your attacks with fire, ice, explosions, and more; lay traps; burn away defenses; and slow your opponents down for some needed breathing room.Magic is not confined to simply attacking and defending, though. Alter the playing field itself with massive spells, from fields of fire to lightning storms to man-eating plants. There are nine different types of magic to find, and experimenting is key to survival.A Character-Driven StoryA knight is sent on a quest he cannot complete. A misfit believes he has ended the world. A mage searches for answers. A blacksmith demands revenge. The portals were supposed to make Vitrerran a better place. They were supposed to save the continent, to unite a divided people. Instead, they brought ruin. Instead, they brought monsters.The Land of Glass is an RPG with eight protagonists spanning four campaigns. Each character is forced to explore the world for the first time, to confront his biases and misconceptions as he tries to stop a magical plague that threatens to eat the continent. While set against an apocalyptic backdrop, The Land of Glass tells stories that are both personal and small—it is a character study first and an epic fantasy second.Because not every quest is noble, and not every world is worth saving.Key Features    Four campaigns with eight different characters    A unique take on deck-based card games    Character driven story    Nine different types of magic    Hundreds of cards to collect    In-depth crafting system    Stained glass art style",Minimum:OS: Windows VistaMemory: 512 MB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 3.0 level Graphics CardStorage: 750 MB available space,Recommended:OS: Windows 10Memory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 4.5 level Graphics CardStorage: 750 MB available space,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,Not supported,43300,82400,15400,82700,0

Every human has one medikit (bind key: F) and a new one is added to your inventory once fully healed by a Medi.Damage system: human body is divided into three parts: head/body/legs, with each part sustaining different damage values.Note: Flamer can change flame to diesel style!AliensAliens do not have a stamina system, therefore they can run and jump freely to their hearts’ content. Any tissue damage inflicted to an alien is regenerated on its own. Certain aliens are capable of wall-climbing.Damage system: Their body is a SINGLE damage system, thus damage to the head and to its legs does not differ.Note: Growing furs!StageBoth teams begin at Stage 1. Higher Stages (2 & 3) allow both teams to field more advanced weaponry/aliens and to build strong and useful structures. Higher stages are achieved by killing a certain amount of enemies – the more players present in your team, the more kills are required.CreditsHumans gain credits by killing enemies (a stronger enemy killed gives you higher rewards), by destroying enemy spawns/the ""Overmind"" as well as with 2 minutes passed in-game. Credits can be used to buy weapons, armor and other equipment in the buildable structure called ""Armoury"".EvosAliens gain evos by killing enemies, by destroying enemy spawns/the ""Reactor"" as well as with every 2 minutes that pass. Evos are used to evolve into a ""higher"" Alien ONLY.Buildable structuresPlayers can build structures only with spare build points (BP) to use and only prior to Sudden Death (SD makes it impossible to build anything else, the standard timelimit for the SD is 30 min).With the Construction Kit, humans are able to build various technological structures. The main structure is the Reactor. Without a Reactor, the human base is powerless and dysfunctional, apart from spawns. The most important structure is the Node – a human spawn. Without Nodes, humans are unable to spawn – a sign of their possible doom. Humans are able to build structures only in the power range of the Reactor, extensible by the Repeater. Any damaged human structures must be healed by a Builder ASAP!With the Granger/Advanced Granger, aliens build their own structures. The main structure is the Overmind. Without an Overmind, the base is left without a mind - no structures apart from spawns work and Mur is unable to fly. The most important structure is the Egg – an alien spawn. Without eggs, aliens cannot spawn and thus may soon get exterminated. Aliens can build structures only in the range of the Overmind or Eggs. Eggs can be built anywhere and have their own range. Any damaged alien structures are regenerated on their own! A structure that loses the range of an Overmind or an Egg self-destructs after a while!DebuffsMost debuffs are intended for humans only. Please, check the bottom left corner of your screen when anything ""odd"" happens to your character. You may find yourself paralyzed, on fire, slowed down, poisoned, webbed etc. In order to get rid of them, sometimes you just have to wait for the debuffs to disappear. Sometimes,you will have to jump into the water, or you will have to jump.

And what if the norse mythology was so precise about the Ragarok because it already happened?That's what a search team of scientifiques found in 2008 during an expedition in the north sea.And almost immediately a secret society named ""the shadow council"" took possession of all the artefacts found.A few years later you have been recruited to run a top secret project: The Bifrost Project.A Base Building gameYour first objectif is to build and then manage a secret base. With a synergy system, you'll need to try and experiment to find the optimal pattern depending of your strategy.

I'm always open to suggestions and improvements.Features- Career mode with 12 levels.- Endless mode.- 23 technologies for research, including four distinctive weapons and a mighty planetary force field.- Manage money, infrastructure, population and keep the people motivated.- Seven (YouTube friendly) spherical songs will help you get in the flow of deflecting asteroids.- Atmospheric sound effects.- Special endgame in story mode (maybe there is more to the asteroids...).Gameplay- Simple physics-based fun.- Don't destroy the asteroids (lame), deflect them!- Asteroids burning up in the star generate money (because... why not?).- Expensive research will improve your weapons.- Impacts on the planet will decimate the population and their moral (may result in losing the game).- After a first learning curve, the gameplay can get quite hypnotic or meditative.- Unlimited continues in career mode, saves are done after each level.- It's all about gravity, mass and kinetic energy - but in a fun way!FAQ* Are there costly ingame purchases or will there be expensive DLC?- No ingame purchases, it's the full game. I'm working on a second campaign, it will be free for all current owners. But will raise the initial price a little for new customers.* I will wait until it is on sale.- I might put it on sale, but only right after a price increase. So the price can only go up (why would I punish early birds?).* Is this a mobile port?- No, but I may port it to mobile (and remove some features in the base version with the ""XL"" in the name, in case you were wondering).* A space cannon would never work!!!1- First of all - it's just a game. And maybe a search for ""Project HARP"" might suprise you.",Minimum:OS: Windows XPProcessor: CeleronMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: AnyStorage: 300 MB available spaceSound Card: Any,Recommended:OS: Windows 10Processor: i3Memory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: AnyStorage: 300 MB available spaceSound Card: Any,Minimum:OS: OS XProcessor: Memory: 500 MB RAMGraphics: AnySound Card: Any,Recommended:OS: OS XProcessor: Memory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: AnySound Card: Any,Minimum:Processor: CeleronMemory: 500 MB RAMGraphics: AnySound Card: Any,Recommended:Processor: i3Memory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: AnySound Card: Any,93800,88800,11400,0,0
1003,688800,Paralysis,Justin Jackson,Violent/Gore/Action/Indie/Early Access,"Mar 23, 2018","Paralysis is an asymmetrical (4vs1) first person horror game. In which four survivors use teamwork to evade the player controlled creature. The creature uses it's vision to track down and take out the survivors, while they attempt to outsmart it.The goal for the survivors is to find key cards around the map then escape without having the creature find you first. This gives the players surviving a goal to complete instead of just a time objective.The game is first person to allow everyone to get a more realistic experience to allow for more scares; The horror genre will be much more prevalent. A 3rd person perspective would allow the players to see around corners, so we made it so that they can only see what the survivor would be able to see.FEATURESAsymmetrical - This means that there will be a 4 versus 1 game play. Where four people play as survivors and one plays as a creature. This allows for a different experience each time, as everyone will play the game differently. This creates many scenarios for both the survivor and the creature.  Teamwork? - When surviving in the game the survivors can choose whether or not to work together. The choice is yours. Do you work better alone? Then stay away from your team and find the key cards yourself. Darkness - While you have to be aware of your surroundings with the creature lurking around, you are in complete darkness. You do however have a flashlight, but be smart as any form of light will attract the creature.  Silence - While most games use music to build up an atmosphere, we chose to remove it all together. Instead the entire map is silent with the sounds of footsteps. This makes Paralysis more eerie and keeps you on your toes. Be aware of your surroundings.PLANNED FEATURESWe do not promise that the following features will make it into the game.
